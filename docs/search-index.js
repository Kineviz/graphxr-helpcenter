makes it easy to build compelling 3D graph visualizations that focus on complex connections in information. In GraphXR you can find answers and communicate results quickly, and also expand upon or re-focus an exploration. A basic GraphXR workflow for investigation and analysis is outlined below, with links to the details that will help you dive right in. 1. Log in and Create a Project Connect to an available graph database (if any) 2. Import Data Database query or drag and drop 3. Navigate and Select Data 4. Set Display Options: Color, Icon, Size 5. Remodel and Transform Data 6. Discover Connected Paths 7. Choose Layouts and Geospatial Maps 8. Share, Save and Export your data views. For insights into the art of effective graph visualization, follow our Blogs. Review example use cases that GraphXR supports in our Video playlist.

The hardware and software requirements are for clients. Can permissions be assigned? Who can view and edit? Options for controlling permissions, editing, and UI access include: Users can be Admins, with the ability to control other users' access to connectors, UI elements, and editing. Users can share Projects, enabling full editing access, or share a View which is a read-only visualization Permissions set up in the database will carry over to GraphXR What are project Extensions? Extensions are plug-ins developed by Kineviz that add to GraphXR functionality. They can be made available to Enterprise subscribers. Examples include various database and API connectors, an Observable-inspired javascript notebook, Visual Query Builder to build no-code Cypher queries, and many others which provide additional custom capabilities. Can data and views be shared as read-only with those who don’t have a user profile? Yes, you can share a View and set access privileges to it. The shared View can be sent as a link directly or embedded as an iframe. This lets you share selected data or publish it to the web. How does GraphXR enable someone who does not have database access to view queries? A user with project-level access can run queries on a remote database. If you only want to show the results of a given query or set of queries, you would use a View. Which kinds of files can be imported or loaded into GraphXR? Many kinds of files can be imported simply by drag and drop: CSV, .JSON. Maltego .mgtx, Google Earth KML (for geolocated data), and GraphXR’s .graphxr and .graphxrsnapshots files. Through the Query panel you can load graph data from a connected database using Cypher (e.g. for Neo4j), SQL (MySQL or MSSQL), and Gremlin. And you can load .CSV and .JSON files with or without querying and mapping the contents. Can I use GraphXR to connect to a MySQL Workbench on a local machine? MySQL Workbench is a client. So you need to create and connect GraphXR to a MySQL server. You can use the connection details you use to connect MySQL Workbench to your MySQL server. Is there any standard or restriction on how to generate the database? GraphXR lets you load data from a variety of databases into memory via queries; the database you query can be any size. There are some best practices that we recommend, however, and can walk through with you. How much information does the free version of GraphXR support? The free version of GraphXR supports as much data as the Pro and Enterprise version. There is no hard limit imposed, just a hardware limit. We recommend keeping your graph under 10,000 nodes for best performance, however on a powerful machine you can load 100,000 plus. Can I use the Neo4j community license for GraphXR. Any limitations? Yes, you can use Neo4j’s community version (e.g. Neo4j Desktop). Limitations would be the hard limits (database size, etc.) set by Neo4j, plus any native user roles available for editing in Neo4j’s community edition. Can you use GraphXR to pass information from Oracle to Neo4j? If you have an Oracle database, you can pipe data directly from Oracle into GraphXR and then from GraphXR to Neo4j. So you can use GraphXR as a tool to pipe data from Oracle to Neo4j. Where can I run a Neo4J (Cypher) query to get only specific information? The Query panel=> Cypher tab lets you enter and run a Cypher query on a Neo4j database. You can write the query to return a graph (nodes and relationships) to the project space. If you write a Cypher query that returns a number or table rather than a graph, the results are shown as a table. You can then transform the resulting table into a graph, with each row as a node. You can also use the Visual Query Builder extension to craft and run a no-code Cypher query. Is added or modified information saved to Neo4j or only on the display? Data loaded into GraphXR lives in memory, so any modifications to it will not be saved automatically back to the database. And when you exit a GraphXR project and open it again, the data will no longer be present. But a user CAN: Write the contents of the graph to Neo4j if granted the appropriate admin privileges. This can be used to update or overwrite a connected DB as needed. Save a data view as a GXRF file, or save Snapshots of the data, and then re-import it. How do I save data to the connected Neo4J database? Under the Project panel=>Data tab, there is a Save to Neo4j button. This is the most seamless method, but data can also be saved as a .GXRF file, a view, or exported as CSVs, which can then be loaded into Neo4j. Can I execute a CREATE or DELETE Cypher query on a Neo4j database connected to GraphXR? Yes, if permission to CREATE or DELETE data have been granted on the Neo4j DB. Otherwise, such a query will fail. Can an ETL job be run in GraphXR? ETL (i.e. Extract from multiple data sources, Transform according to business rules, and Load to GraphXR) can be set up and run in GraphXR’s Grove Extension, a JavaScript/Observable notebook application currently in beta release. Where do the relationships listed in the Expand function come from? For data you select in GraphXR, Expand shows relationships that exist in the connected graph database (e.g. Neo4j) for the categories present in the selected data. Expand essentially queries the database for additional data. Where do the categories and relationships used for Pull in Project>Category come from? Categories and relationships that exist in the connected Neo4j database are automatically displayed in the Project panel. Pull queries the database for data of that category or relationship, 25 nodes or edges at a time. How is MySQL information transformed into GraphXR’s nodes and relationships? The mapping editor in the Query panel => SQL tab enables you to define the logic for generating relationships for a single table. Can I create one-to-many relationships between multiple CSVs without using Cypher? Yes. Import the CSV data into GraphXR as nodes. Then you can use GraphXR’s Add Edge tool to select source and target nodes and apply a new or existing relationship to the new edges that are created. Why do new categories and relationships persist in the Project panel after all their nodes and edges are deleted? When you create new categories or relationships they are added to the existing GraphXR project schema, which persists (even if there are no data associated with it) until you exit the project and reload it. If your project was connected to a Neo4j database AND you wrote the new data types to it, the new entities will persist. Otherwise any “orphan” categories or relationships will be deleted. Can I save the new relationship generated by the Shortcut function onto a Neo4j database? Yes, you can save new relationships (and categories) to Neo4j, if the database is set up to allow it. Neo4j validation can be set up to reject data of types that aren’t already defined. In that case, you’d need to change constraints on the DB side. A new relationship and its edges are simply added to the extensible graph data. Data collision wouldn’t happen because a new relationship (or category) has to have a unique name—​one not already in use. Is the graph visualization rendered in the server or the browser? Currently, it’s 100% in the browser. How are edge lengths computed in GraphXR? Edge length is computed using force layout. We don’t consider individual edge strength, so if a group of nodes has many connections between them, they will be relatively closer to each other. In the Force layout tab, what does Link Strength, Link Distance, and_Gravity_ mean? How are they used? Link Strength, Link Distance, and Gravity are parameters used in the force-directed graph drawing algorithm, which is used to render the force-directed layout. This class of algorithms assign specific physical forces to the edges and nodes of a graph, such that edges are of similar length, connected nodes are attracted to one another, as few crossed edges are created as possible, and the distribution of nodes in 3D space is reasonably symmetric. Adjusting the parameters lets you change how the force layout is calculated: how spread out the nodes are, how long the edges are, and how compact the display becomes. How are URL images applied to nodes when the Show Avatar setting is enabled? An attempt to load a URL image will occur when there is a property key of _photo, photo, avatar, image, picture, or icon and a property value starting with http, https, or ftp. Formats supported are jpg, jpeg, png, gif, and bmp. The image is displayed when the node is at a fixed virtual distance. A node further away than that receives the basic Category color and current icon overlay, if any. How can I make nodes appear highlighted from the center? There’s not an internal glow or light source option. However, you can create that effect by choosing a light color for the relationship and showing the edge’s arrowheads. Select the color using the list in the legend, and in Project>Settings make sure the Hide Arrow checkbox is not selected. What is Ego Depth in the Geometric layout options? The Ego Depth layout lets you select a node (or nodes) as centers and arrange its neighbors in either ring or tree patterns according to their separation from the center. You set a Depth value (for example, 3) to disregard any node more than that many edges away from the center node. Does geo-location mapping support using a custom map server? Yes. Go to Map>Settings to display the Map Settings dialog where you can add your own map server. Where are the views created in Project>Data saved? Data Views are saved to the GraphXR server (and from there, can be shared with another user of your project). Note that Save GXRF, Save CSV, and the export of a Snapshots archive or the of a Mapping saves files to your local system (for example, MacOS Downloads folder), and you can navigate to them using the selector at the top of the Chrome browser window. Up to 10 snapshots can be saved in a Snapshot archive. Is there any limitation on saving Views? You can save up to 100 data Views. How can I move an entire selection of nodes at once? Select the data, and left-click-mouse drag. (Many other mouse and keyboard shortcutsfor navigating your graph data are also available.) What is the difference between 2D and XR? XR requires a VR headset and a PC with a dedicated GPU. The 2D mode enables you to work with a 3D space that’s projected onto a 2D screen (desktop, laptop, etc.). Is there a course to learn GraphXR? The How to GraphXR hands-on tutorial series provides an overview of how to use key GraphXR functionality to import, model, and explore graph data. We also offer personalized training to Enterprise users. Where can we find help or blogs to craft effective graph layouts? Our GraphXR Blog and Video channels contain many examples for both general and specific use cases. We are also happy to work directly with you.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"faq","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-learning/faq.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation and Administration","hash":"_installation_and_administration","id":1},{"text":"Sharing Data and Views","hash":"_sharing_data_and_views","id":2},{"text":"Importing, Querying, and Saving Data","hash":"_importing_querying_and_saving_data","id":3},{"text":"Data Modeling and Mapping in GraphXR","hash":"_data_modeling_and_mapping_in_graphxr","id":4},{"text":"Graph Data Rendering and Visualization","hash":"_graph_data_rendering_and_visualization","id":5},{"text":"Navigating Graph Data","hash":"_navigating_graph_data","id":6},{"text":"GraphXR with VR/XR","hash":"_graphxr_with_vrxr","id":7},{"text":"Learning GraphXR","hash":"_learning_graphxr","id":8}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Follow our Blogs showcasing GraphXR solutions.

The map servers provided by default are Mapbox, Google, and OpenStreetMap. When you open the Map panel, a world map is displayed and nodes in the project space that have latitude and longitude property values are automatically dropped onto the map. Nodes with no latitude and longitude coordinates which are connected to those on the map are also displayed with their connecting edges, positioned above the map. By default, a force-directed layout is used for these nodes, unless a geometric layout has been applied to them. Nodes with geospatial coordinates are pinned to the map until you hide the map, at which time they are released and displayed in the default force-directed layout. Geospatial data must be encoded in the data in separate latitude(lat) and longitude(lng) properties as follows: Property Name Example Value Latitude lat -74.006393 Longitude lng 40.714172 The lat and lng values must be floating point, not strings. Most lat-long data are encoded that way, but if not, strings can be transformed using toNumber or a custom transform in the f(x) transform panel. The .KML and .KMZ (Keyhole Markup Language/Keyhole Markup Zip) files used by mapping applications such as Google Earth contain appropriately encoded coordinates, and you can map these files directly in GraphXR. When you click Map in the Main Menu, the Map panel opens, automatically displaying nodes pinned to their geospatial locations on a 2D map surface rendered in the 3D graph space. Desktop navigation and data selection is the same as for other layouts. You can: Navigate the mapped nodes using any GraphXR navigation method (for example, pan, zoom, rotate, Center To a single node or selection of nodes, and Fly Out to view all the mapped data) Select nodes using any selection method, and perform any of the data transformations, editing, or tagging available in the graph space. Save data views or snapshots for use in data visualization. For example, we can tag groups of nodes according to regions on the map. Select the nodes, and click Tag to open the Manager Tags dialog. YOu can also click Save Tags as Property to save the tags as a _ graphxrtags property, then used the Property list set persistent colors for each value. If tags aren’t saved as a property, they appear as white bubbles in the legend’s Tags list. You can click the list bubble to select these tagged nodes, but since they don’t appear in the Property list, you cannot assign a color or icon. In the map below, tags have been created to assign regions to sets of nodes. You can use a tag to select nodes by region then click the Center To icon to zoom in to the center point of the selection on the map. Click the Map menu item to display the Map panel, which includes: Show Map to re-set the map (for example, after you have zoomed in to selected data, or flown away to a search location). Hide Map to dismiss the map and return the mapped data to the default force layout. Search Location bar to enter a place name and fly to that location. Map Control to reposition the map and adjust its boundaries. Setting to select a map server, install custom map servers, and set Mode and Auto Fitting options. Opening the Map panel automatically displays a map with boundaries set according to the coordinates in your data, and drops your graph data onto it. Click Hide Map to hide the map and return the data to the default force layout. Click Show Map to: Show the initial map again after using Hide Map. Reset the map to its initial position after using Search Location or Map Control. You can click the Map panel icon to dismiss the panel. This only removes the panel, not the map. When you are done working with a map, click Map to open the panel, then click Hide Map. You can fly to any named world location or region by entering its name in the Search Location bar. There does not need to be any mapped data for that location. To fly to a named location: Open the Map panel. In the Search Location bar, enter the name of a location (e.g. United Kingdom) and click it on the search list. The map centers on the named location. To reset the map, clear the search by clicking the X icon in the search bar, then click Show Map. A map boundary is initially set based on the locations in the graph data, but a wider view is often desirable, for example, to display additional areas for which there is no data. Map Control mode lets you adjust the map boundary temporarily. When you click Map Control, 3D navigation is de-activated. To adjust map boundaries: Open the Map panel and click Map Control. The button turns blue, indicating you are in map control mode. Set the map boundaries with the following mouse controls or their equivalent keyboard shortcuts: Pan (left mouse click_drag) Zoom (mouse scroll or 2+left mouse click drag) Click Map Control to exit and resume 3D navigation with the adjusted map. Whenever you click Show Map, map boundaries are reset to the initial area bounded by the locations in the data. To retain adjusted boundaries you set in Map Control, de-select the AutoFitting checkbox in the Setting dialog. Map Setting options let you: Select an installed map server (e.g. MapBox, Google or OpenStreetMap) Add or delete custom map servers. Set Wall or Floor mode.

The Path Finding algorithm traces the path between a set of selected start and end nodes and applies an optional weight. Centrality and Community Detection algorithms evaluate each node in the graph and return a numerical measure of its connectedness or grouping. For an e-book introduction to graph algorithms and their uses, see Graph Algorithms: Practical Examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j. The Path Finding algorithm traces the shortest path between selected start and end nodes. If relationships in the path have a property that can be used as a weighting factor, you can select a path weighting factor. The nodes and edges on the path are traced and selected. Once a path has been successfully traced, you can click Spotlight Path to display only the nodes and edges involved. To find a path between connected nodes: Open the Algorithm panel and Path Finding tab. Select one or more starting nodes in the graph, and click Add to Start. Your selected nodes are listed in Start Nodes. Note: An error message displays if you select too many start and end nodes such that there are more than ten pairs for tracing the shortest path. Now select ending nodes in the graph, and click Add to End. The selected nodes are listed in End Nodes. Note: You can click Remove Start Node or Remove End Node to delete your current selection and choose other nodes. In the Weight Property menu you can select a property of one of the relationships in the path to be used as a path weighting value, or leave the default Ignore Weight Property selected. If the relationships have no properties (which is often the case), Ignore Weight Property will be the only choice. Click Trace Path to display and select the nodes and edges for the shortest path(s) between your start and end nodes. Click Spotlight Path to display only the nodes and edges in the path. The button label changes to Un-spotlight Path. At this point, you can tag the path, and save the tag as a property so that you can easily find it again. You may also want to save and share a data View, export a GXRF file, or save and export a Snapshot. Once you are done inspecting the path, click Un-spotlight Path to return the all the data to the graph. Note that the path will no longer be selected. However, the start and end nodes persist in the Path Finding tab until you remove them, so you can click Trace Path again. To find a path between a single start and end node, select the two nodes, then select Find Path from the right-click menu. Then, to isolate (i.e. spotlight) the path, select Inverse, then Hide Selection. You can now tag the path and/or save the view as needed. For a path with a single start and end node this might be faster than opening the Path Finding algorithm panel. GraphXR includes a selection of commonly used Centrality or Community Detection algorithms, which are designed to calculate measures of connectedness (both with respect to distance and strength of connection) in multi-dimensional data. There are many such algorithms, and each has its own characteristic behavior and strengths. When you run a Centrality or Community Detection algorithm the computed result is added as a property to each node in the graph. The following table lists the available algorithms and the property names GraphXR uses to store the results. Algorithm Type Algorithm Property Name Centrality PageRank pageRank Centrality Betweenness betweenness Centrality Closeness closeness Centrality Eigenvector eigenvector Community Detection Connected Component componentId Community Detection Strong Connected Component strongComponentId Community Detection Louvain louvainComponentId Community Detection Label Propagation labelPropagationId The numerical results can be displayed (for example, in a scatter plot), accessed for other processes within GraphXR, or exported for use in other graph analytics or statistics applications. To run a Centrality or Community Detection algorithm: In the Algorithm panel, click to open the Centrality or Community Detection tab. Click the button for the algorithm you want to run. A message displays when the calculation is finished. The property and calculated value is added to each node in the graph. To see the results, you can: Open a table.

In GraphXR, click About at the bottom left of the project space, then click on the current release tag to display a digest of features introduced in current and past releases. Show the nodes in a collection in a Table. You can now select a collection node and display a table of its contents. Select the collection node, open the Table panel, and click the category of the nodes in the collection. Also, in-graph search and filtering now operates on the nodes in a collection. Animated Filters. Filters include an auto-play function, which enables animated display of data by numerical, lat-long, or date-time properties. The animation can be set to loop continuously over a specified time interval. This enables creation of animated views of data, which can be shared through an iframe. Improved Data Views. A maximum of 100 data views (increased from just 10) can be created. Data views can be shared individually with any user. In the Project>Data tab and views list, click the Share icon to open the shared view. Its url can be copied and shared with any user. Project UI Configuration. User interface elements can now be configured from within the project. The configuration UI also enables display of icons to access extensions on the left menu below the panel icons. In the Project>Settings tab, click UI Configuration (located at the bottom of the Settings panel). The UI Configuration dialog is displayed. Click to set the visibility of UI elements (visible to everyone, only to project users, or hidden from everyone), and click Save to return to the project space. Categories and Relationships can be re-named directly using the Enhanced Table. Open the Table panel, click to select the category and click to open the Enhanced Table. Double-click the category (or relationship) label to edit it, and click return. The label is immediately updated in the graph. For Enterprise clients, Project Templates can be configured at the server level, such that Category settings, node sizes, and more are already set. Templates are created and edited by admin users on the server through /admin and are available for selection when a non-admin user creates or edits a project. Multiple templates can be configured. A template enables the administrator to: Define the initial project settings Define styling for a predefined list of Categories and Relationships. ** Remove unneeded UI elements and add UI buttons on the left menu to access selected extensions. + image::/V2_15_08_ProjectTemplates_Configure.png[,520,420,role=text-left] In the Project>Data tab, the Download Category and Relationship Settings button saves settings from an existing project as a .json file which can then be imported into a template. Usability Improvements. Improved keyboard/mouse/trackpad navigation and selection. To move any selection of nodes, simply left-click+drag. To center a node in the project space, hold c and double-click the node. (Simply double-clicking a node displays its Information window). To zoom in or out quickly, use Alt (or Option) +mouse (or trackpad) scroll*.* To select the nodes or edges of more than one Category or Relationship, or the nodes or edges with specific property values, Ctrl + left click the items in the Legend. __ The contextual toolbar includes the additional Quick Layout icon, which displays a menu to apply one of the basic geometric layouts in one click (Line, Grid, Cube, Circle, Spiral, and Spring), or the Tree or Ring layouts to a selection (or to all the data). The layout can be adjusted using Expand or Contract menu items. Quick layouts may be adequate for initial exploration. Full features to display data by property value and to position data in the project space remain available in the Geometric layout panel. In the Layout > Geometric tab The nodes in Ring or Tree layouts can be arranged by a property value. In the *Project>_Category tab A Clean button lets you remove a category not in the currently connected database, or, for a project not connected to a database, a category not in the data currently in the graph. In the Project>Settings tab A 2D Mode checkbox reduces rendering to the 2D plane. When 2D mode is enabled, the Z Compress slider in the Layout>Force tab is hidden, since a Z-axis is not rendered. The Neo4j Database menu that enables selection of a different database from within a project appears only when the project is connected to a Neo4j database. The UI Configuration button is added. None Visual Query Builder. Build Cypher queries using no-code building blocks. Category blocks include plus + icons to add a relationship and category block to a query in one step. This makes it faster and easier to modify a visual query. A single category block can now include a connection to more than one relationship block. Grove (beta-release).

In GraphXR, click About at the bottom left of the project space, then click on the current release tag to display a digest of features introduced in current and past releases. Right-click Menu. The right-click menu is re-designed to provide easier access to often-used toolbar and layout functionality. Its elements can also be customized. Default right-click menu items are: Information Add Node Add Edge Select, Actions, and Layout submenus: Select: All Nodes, Add to Selection, Subtract from Selection, Invert, Deselect, select Floating Nodes (those with no connected edges), Leaf Nodes (those with only one connected edge), Neighbor Nodes or Neighbor Edges (for selected nodes), and Connected Nodes (for selected edges). Actions: The new Change Category function, Collect Nodes or Explode Nodes in collections, Tag, Hide or Show Hidden, Pin, and Release. Layout: the same Quick Layout menu available on the bottom toolbar. In 2D mode, the 3D layouts (Cube and Spring) are grayed out and unavailable. Expand Find Path. A new function that traces a path between two selected nodes, similar to Trace Path in the Algorithm panel, except that the algorithm panel includes a Spotlight / Un -spotlight Path toggle. From the right-click menu, you can isolate the path using Select> Invert to select data not on the path, then Actions>Hide to hide those data. Center To Fly Out Delete Change Category. From the right-click Actions>Change Category menu, nodes can be assigned to a new or existing category. All the properties of the selected nodes will be transferred to the selected category. An existing category would therefore include both the existing and newly added properties. Change Category cannot be undone using Ctrl-Z. Before using Change Category, take a snapshot, save a data view, or save a GXRF file to enable quick recovery from a mistaken change. Display and Selection in the Legend. Category, Relationship, and Property lists can be hidden by clicking the tab on the Legend. Ctrl-click to select more than one Category, Relationship, Property, or Tag from the list. Styling dialogs now include additional Avatar, Size, and Caption tabs for categories, Bind Width and Caption tabs for relationships, and a color and icon picker for individual properties and tags. It is no longer necessary to open the Settings panel to access these controls. Filter Enhancements. Filter categorical (text string) property values. Node or edge property values which are text strings (as opposed to numerical, date or lat-long values) can now be filtered. A categorical filter displays a list of the unique string values found in the selected property. Selection checkboxes are provided, as well as a Match function to filter data using a search string or regular expression. Filter continuous (numerical) values as categorical ones. For numerical property values, a Continuous / Categorical toggle lets you filter numerical values as text strings. This can be useful for filtering properties with integer numerical values. Select Categories or Relationships to be filtered. When a property name is used in more than one category (or relationship) the filter displays an active list you can use to select the labels to be filtered. Chart. For continuous filters (numerical, date, latitude, or longitude property values), a live histogram (bar chart) of the data being filtered is displayed by default. The Chart checkbox lets you hide or show the histogram, and a Number of Buckets selector is provided to set the maximum number of bars in the chart. Named and parameterized Cypher queries. In the Query>Cypher panel, users can create named Cypher queries that include a descriptive name and optional input parameters. Once stored to the project, queries are available in shared projects and data views. This enables the creation of a set of standard queries that can be used by any of the project’s users. The + button to add a Cypher query to the collection of stored queries opens an Alias Name dialog asking you to enter and confirm a name when storing the query. Stored queries are listed in the Query panel. As soon as they are stored on the project, other project users on other machines can access and run them. A query can be parameterized by using the special syntax $param in the query definition. For example: MATCH (n:Person {age: $age}) RETURN n See Parameters - Cypher Manual for details. Running a query that includes parameters displays a dialog asking the user to enter appropriate values for the parameters. Optionally, a shared view on the project can run a query by specifying the name of the query and key value pairs for the parameters. Map Enhancements. Map configuration details persist (including map boundaries set using Map Control) and are saved in data views, snapshots, and .GXRF export files. Navigation, Selection, and Visibility Enhancements. Properties of a Category or Relationship, which by default are displayed in alphabetical order, can be re-ordered in the Project panel by clicking arrow icons that appear on rollover at the left edge of the property list. The new order is immediately updated in information windows. The Settings panel now includes an Auto Caption checkbox, which is selected by default. Double click a node or edge to display its information panel. Deleting a node closes its Information window. Edges can be selected more easily. Additional shortcut keys Orbit around x, y, or z axes: x: ctrl+alt+shift+o (Mac); ctrl+alt+shift+o (Windows) y: ctrl+o (Mac); shift+o (Windows) z: ctrl+shift+o (Mac); alt+shift+o (Windows) Select all orphaned nodes: shift+D Improved Security and User Access.

In this Session…​ Before you begin…​ Graph Data Anatomy GraphXR Interface Create a GraphXR account Slide Text 2 Welcome to GraphXR! These basic tutorials will give you a detailed overview of how to visualize and explore graph data. Let’s start by creating an account at graphxr.kineviz.com. 3 On logging in you’re taken to the Projects page. You can create a new project (and connect it to a Neo4j database), or open an existing demo or shared project. We’ll click Create to create a new project. Enter a name for your project and click Confirm. 4 Click the arrow icon on your new Project to enter the graph space. 5 We’re now in the project’s graph environment, a 3-dimensional, functionally infinite space which is currently empty. Before we proceed, let’s quickly review the anatomy of graph data. 6 GraphXR uses a labeled property graph (LPG) data model, in which graphs are composed of three elements: nodes, edges, and properties. 7 Nodes are entities, like people or events. They’re represented by a circle which can display an icon or portrait image. Nodes with the same entity label comprise a Category. 8 Edges are connections between nodes, like VISITED or LIVES_AT. All edges of a given type comprise a Relationship. Directed relationships like PARENT_OF have an arrow at one end, while directionless ones like FRIENDS_WITH do not. 9 The structure of nodes and edges in a graph is referred to as a pattern. Their position of patterns in 3D space is governed by the current Layout. 10 By default, GraphXR distributes nodes in space using a physics simulation called Force Direct. Each node pushes away from other nodes while edges pull them together. There is no intrinsic meaning to node position or edge length in the Force Direct layout. 11 Properties are attributes expressed as key-value pairs like name:Andy or color:blue. In addition to user-defined properties, each node and edge has a unique identifier. 12 Now let’s take a quick tour of the GraphXR interface. The Menu bar contains the menu panels: Project, Query, Transform, Table, Layout, Filter, Algorithm, and Map. 13 You can click the Main Menu icon to display panel names along with the icons. GUI navigation controls for the 3D project space are located on the lower right. 14 Use the Search bar for full-text search of property values, either of the data in a connected Neo4jdatabase, or the data in the graph space. 15 The Legend displays lists of the elements currently in the graph. We’ve brought in data to show what this looks like. Click the tabs to select elements to display (Category, Property, Tag, and/or Relationship), then click a list item to select nodes or edges of a specific type. 16 The contextual toolbar menu along the bottom of the project space displays currently available tools. You can also right click to display a pop-up context menu. 17 When you select one or more nodes or edges, additional tools display. We’ll show how to use these in the next few tutorials. Now we’re ready to load data from the Game of Thrones repository.

Using Trace Neighbor. To follow along, download: HowTo_10START.graphxr Slide Text 3 Open the Algorithm panel to run a variety of commonly used graph algorithms against your data. Algorithms are organized in Path Finding, Centrality, and Community Detection tabs. 4 The Path Finding tab provides an algorithm to highlight the shortest path between the two sets of nodes. 5 Select starting nodes and click Add to Start, then select ending nodes and click Add to End. Now click Trace Path. 6 With a complicated graph it can be hard to see the path. You can click the Spotlight Path toggle to see only the nodes and edges involved in the path. 7 Click Un-spotlight Path to see the entire graph again. + TIP: You can Tag the spotlit path nodes or take a Snapshot. 8 A brief aside: the Trace Neighbor toolbar icon provides another way to explore the paths from selected nodes (but not to a specified set of ending nodes). 9 Select one or more nodes and click the Trace Neighbor toolbar icon. A slider control shows the number of path steps in the graph, and lets you choose the number to highlight. 10 You can click Select Visible to select the highlighted path, then click Inverse and Hide Selected to hide the data not on the highlighted path. Now back to algorithms…​ 11 Centrality algorithms include Degree, PageRank, Betweenness, and Closeness. Simply click to run, and a property and value for that algorithm will be added to all the nodes in the graph. 12 You can open a Table to see the new properties, or an Enhanced Table to edit and export results. 13 We’ve already used the Degree algorithm and its gxr_degree property to filter out nodes with no connections from the graph. You can also use the property to focus on the most heavily connected nodes in the graph. 14 Community Detection includes Connected Component, Strong Connected Component, Louvain and Label Propagation algorithms. 15 Again, click to run and a property and its value for that algorithm is added to all the nodes in the graph. 16 A thorough overview of graph algorithms and their uses is available in: https://neo4j.com/lp/book-graph-algorithms-ms/ .

You can create a new category or choose an existing one, and enter values for existing properties or create new ones. We’ll add a House node and add its houseName property. Click Create to see the new node. 6 Now we can connect a few Characters to the new House node. Click the Add Edge icon in the toolbar. 7 Enter a relationship name or select an existing one. We’ll add BELONGS_TO edges. Select the Character nodes to be connected and click As Source, then our new House node and click As Target. 8 You can click Switch to reverse the direction of the relationship. And you can enter property names if desired. We don’t need to do either one. Now click Create to see your new edges. 9 The selected Character nodes are now connected to the House node we created by new BELONGS_TO edges. 10 To remove selected nodes and their edges, at any time you can click the Delete icon or use your keyboard delete key. 11 You can edit your graph data directly using a table. First though, take a Snapshot. Now open the Table panel, then click Enhanced Table. 12 The Enhanced Table editor lets you edit, add, or remove graph data. Changes take effect immediately in the graph. Click the Airplane icon to display the Enhanced Table in a new window. 13 Click any Category or Relationship bubble to edit its label. 14 Click the property menu to select properties to display in the table. Click the x on a property label to hide it. 15 Any property value can be edited. The change takes effect immediately in the graph. 16 Click the square at the far left to select rows, then click More Actions and Mark Selected in Graph to show only those nodes or edges in the basic table and to select them in the graph. 17 Click More Actions and Remove to delete selected nodes or edges from the table and from the graph. 18 At any time, you can click More Actions and Export CSV to export all or part of the data as a CSV file. Now dismiss the Enhanced Table window to return to the project space. 19 Any edits in the Enhanced Table are now included in the graph. Next, in Module 12. Geospatial Mapping, we’ll work with GraphXR features for displaying data on a world map.","title":"11 Editing","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"11-editing","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-learning/how-to-graphxr/11-editing.html","titles":[]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"In this Session…​ Before you begin…​ Using the Map panel to display graph data on a world map.

First, click the Clear toolbar icon to delete any data in the graph space. 4 Now drag and drop the Locations.kml file onto the project space. KeyholeMarkup Language (.kml) and Keyhole Markup Zip (.kmz) files are used by mapping applications such as Google Earth. Since they include latitude and longitude coordinates we can map the resulting nodes in GraphXR. 5 A node is created for each filming location. Open the Table panel to see the locations and their latitude / longitude properties. 6 The category name isn’t very descriptive, so let’s click to open an Enhanced Table and re-label the category as Location. 7 Now open the Map panel to display the world map (powered by Mapbox). The Location nodes are dropped onto the map and the map automatically zooms to display just the locations present in the data. 8 You can search for locations by name in the Search Location bar. Click a location name to center the map on it. 9 Click the Map Control toggle to set map boundaries. You can pan the map with left click drag and zoom with mouse scroll. While in Map Control mode, 3D navigation is disabled. 10 By default, map boundaries are auto-fitted to the data when you close and re-open the map panel. To have your map boundaries persist, click the map Settings button and de-select the Auto Fitting checkbox. 11 Now click to deactivate Map Control to return to 3D navigation. You still zoom using mouse scroll, but now left click drag rotates and tilts the map in three dimensions. 12 Now let’s group our locations by hotter or cooler climate. To do that, we’ll use the Tag function to create temporary groups of nodes regardless of their existing category. Select nodes toward the south and click the Tag icon. 13 In the Manager Tags dialog, enter a tag label (Warmer) and click Add Tag. 14 We’ve now created a tag called “_Warme_r” containing 37 nodes. A badge appears on each tagged node. If we want to remove the tag, we could click Clean Node Tags, but let’s create a few more tags instead. 15 In the graph, select mid-latitude nodes in the UK, click the Tag icon and add a `\"Cooler`\" tag. Go back to the graph and select nodes in Iceland and add a “Cold” tag. Optionally, click Save Tags as Property to add a _graphxrtags property to all tagged nodes. 16 The tag label (e.g. Warmer, Cooler, or Cold) is entered as the _graphxrtags property value. If you give a node more than one tag, the tag labels are separated by colons. 17 So far nothing visibly changed in the graph. Let’s switch to Tag mode in the Legend. Now nodes for our three tags are given separate colors. 18 Click a tag label to select all nodes with that tag. Click the dot next to the tag label to choose a different tag color. 19 We’ve used the default Mapbox map server so far. In the Map panel, click Settings to choose a different available Map Server such as Google or OpenStreetMaps. 20 The map changes immediately when you select a different map server. 21 When you click Hide Map, the nodes, which were pinned to the 3D map, are released and returned to a Force layout. 22 With the Map panel open, you can click Show Map again to drop the nodes back on the map. Next, in Module 13. Querying, we’ll introduce GraphXR features for pulling in data from a connected Neo4j graph database.","title":"12 Geospatial Mapping and Tagging","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"12-geospatial-mapping-and-tagging","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-learning/how-to-graphxr/12-geospatial-mapping-and-tagging.html","titles":[]},"22":{"id":22,"text":"In this Session…​ Before you begin…​ Using Cypher to query a Neo4j database. Pulling data using Expand. Pulling data by category. Pulling data using keyword search. To follow along: * Log in to GraphXR and open the Game of Thrones Demo Project. Slide Text 3 We’ll open a demo project connected to a Neo4j graph database and pull its data into GraphXR in various ways. (If you are in a project space, click the Home button to exit and return to the Projects page.) 4 Click Select Demo and choose the Game of Thrones demo. 5 Click the Game of Thrones tile to enter its project space. 6 The project graph space will be blank, since we have not yet queried for data. In the Project panel we can review the categories and relationships defined for the Neo4j database connected to this demo project. 7 Let’s also look at the current database schema, to see how the categories and relationships are connected to each other. Open the Query panel and Cypher tab and enter the following Cypher query: CALL db.schema.visualization Then click the run arrow. 8 In Project→Settings tab click Show Relationship Name. Then use Quick Layout toolbar menu to display the schema entities in a circle. 9 The schema includes many relationships around the Character category. To see these in more detail, double click the Character node to display its Information panel, then select the Neighbors tab. 10 Though our schema is complex, we can start with a simple Cypher query for Characters who belong to a House. Then we can use the no-code Expand toolbar icon to pull in additional data connected through specific relationships. 11 Go to the Query panel and Cypher tab. First, we’ll briefly look at the basic Cypher query provided as an example. Click the display menu and select the query. 12 MATCH (n)-[r]-(m) RETURN * LIMIT 100 This example query will: MATCH any pattern of nodes n and m connected by any relationship r and RETURN the first 100 found. Click the run arrow. 13 It’s prudent to set a LIMIT with such a non-specific query; otherwise it can return a large amount of data or even time-out before completing the query. 14 We can also set a limit by entering Max Return records allowed. This overrides any larger limit set in the LIMIT qualifier. Now let’s clear the graph and create our own more specific query. 15 MATCH (c:Character)-[r:belongs_to]-(h:House) RETURN * Here we query for the pattern (Character) - [belongs_to] - (House). The variables c, r, and h can be used in further commands rather than the full category or relationship name. We’ll set a limit of 100 returns in Max Returns.. 16 Now click the run arrow to the right of the query to pull in data. The query returned (Character) - [belongs_to] - (House) patterns that included 98 total nodes: 85 Character and 13 House nodes. 17 Click the save icon to save the query. The display icon shows a dropdown menu of saved queries. For information about using Cypher, full details and free learning resources for developers are available through Neo4j. 18 Now that we have data in the graph space, we’ll use Expand to pull additional data connected to selected nodes. Select our Character nodes and click the Expand icon. 19 In the Expand with relationships dialog, you can expand on all available relationships, 1000 edges at a time. Let’s choose All and click Expand. 20 Now we see many additional relationships (character_in_scene, killed_by, etc.), and the nodes of additional categories that they are connected to. We’ve expanded the first 2000 relationships; there are many more than that in this graph. 21 We can select House nodes and apply a Quick Layout (e.g. Ring) to more easily visualize and explore this graph further. 22 But we may not need (or want) to see the entire graph. With Expand we also have an “inside out” workﬂow: we can start with one or a few nodes and expand on just the relationships we want to explore. 23 For example, let’s expand on family relationships among characters in House Tully. First let’s locate those nodes. Open the Table panel, click the House category, enter '`Tully' in the search bar and click the search result to center on the node. 24 Let’s remove the other data. Select the Tully House node and its two connected Character nodes, click Inverse, and press the delete key (or Delete icon). 25 Now select the two connected Character nodes and open the Expand dialog.Click the sibling_with, married_to, and parent_of relationships and click Expand. Note: Set Character and House name as captions in the Project→Category tab. 26 Next we can find scenes that included one or more characters. Select a Character node (e.g. Catelyn Stark), open the Expand dialog, select the character_in_scene and belongs_to relationships, and click Expand. 27 We now see Scene nodes and a House node associated with the selected Character node. We can delete nodes and their connected edges at any time. Let’s select the Scene nodes and press delete. 28 We can also pull a sample of data for a selected category or relationship 25 nodes or edges at a time. In the Project → Category tab, select the Character category and click Pull. 29 Character nodes are pulled from the database, along with any relationships between the pulled nodes and with nodes already in the graph. Now click the Relationship tab. 30 Select the belongs_to relationship and click Pull. Remember that an edge does not exist by itself - it must be connected to two nodes. So a sample of edges can pull in node categories that aren’t already in the graph. 31 Since our demo database is configured for keyword search, we can search for property values in the Search Bar and return matching nodes. See that the search from database icon is displayed. Enter a search term (e.g. the name '`Lannister'). 32 Click the plus (+) icon to pull all nodes of a specific category, or click a single line to pull just one node. Notice that only nodes are pulled using a search, not edges. 33 We can use Expand to connect edges of specific relationships. With the Character nodes returned by our search pulled in and selected, open the Expand dialog, choose the belongs_to relationship, and click Expand. 34 We’ve queried a Neo4j database using Cypher, and used GraphXR’s Expand, sampling, and keyword search. GraphXR also supports query of graph databases using Gremlin, query and mapping a SQL table or CSV file, and query of JSON documents. 35 Next, in Module 14.

You can do this with a CSV mapping. Clear the graph space, then open the Query panel and CSV tab. 4 Click Load CSV, navigate to the Lines.csv file in your Game of Thrones dataset (GXR_QSG.zip) and select it. 5 The number of rows and columns in Lines.csv is displayed and a preview of the file is displayed below. 6 Click New to open the Mapping Editor and create a new mapping for this data. We’ll use it to define the graph pattern: (Words)-[SPOKEN_ON]-(Episode) and map wordCount, speaker, and seasonEpisode columns as properties. 7 As a brief aside: we’re mapping a CSV here, but the Mapping Editor can also be used to model data from a table in a connected SQL database. 8 The Mapping Editor opens with a single category icon in place. For our model we need two categories connected by a relationship. Select Add Edge, click the category icon and drag. This adds the edge and a second category icon in one step. 9 Now that we have our two categories connected by a single relationship, we’ll rename them and select columns from the CSV that will become properties. 10 Click the Category1 icon, and in Category Name, enter “Words”. Add its properties by selecting from the menu or clicking the + icon. We’ll add wordCount and speaker. 11 Click the Category2 icon and in Category Name enter “Episodes”. Click to add the seasonEpisode property. We can rename properties-we’ll just call it episode. Click As Key to create a single node for each unique value of the property. 12 Now click the relationship icon. It has been assigned a default name based on the initial source and target categories. 13 In Relationship Name, rename the relationship SPOKEN_ON. We could also add and rename properties, but for this model we don’t need to. 14 Once you are satisfied with your mapping, click the Save As icon to enter a name for new mapping and save it. (Use Save and Exit for an existing mapping you’ve edited.) 15 Click the Export Schema icon to export the mapping as a JSON file. This saves it on your local system, and from there you can import it to any GraphXR project. 16 When you save, the Mapping Editor window closes and the mapping appears in the Mapping dropdown menu. Click Apply to apply it to our Lines.csv data. 17 You can edit any mapping to add, remove, or rename categories, relationships, or properties. Select it in the Mapping menu and click Edit to open the Mapping Editor. 18 The mapping remains in the project’s Mapping menu unless you delete it. To import a mapping, click Import, navigate to the local JSON file and select it. 19 Congratulations! By completing this learning series, you’re well on your way to mastering GraphXR!

Characters.csv is a table of the characters from HBO’s Game of Thrones. Each row corresponds to one character. The columns contain the name, family (house) affiliation, how many characters they killed, who killed them, and a URL of the character’s portrait. 4 When we drag and drop Characters.csv onto our GraphXR project space, a node is automatically created for each row of the spreadsheet. 5 The spreadsheet data is treated as a single category labeled Characters, now visible in the Legend at the top right. 6 Columns in the Characters.csv spreadsheet (characterName, houseName, etc.)become properties of the nodes. To see a table of the nodes and their properties click to open the Table panel and click the Characters category. 7 Image URLs in each row provide a portrait image for a Character node. This avatar can be shown or hidden via the Project panel => Settings tab => Show Avatars. 8 Let’s learn to navigate in 3D space. To pan the graph up, down, left, and right, hold down the left mouse button and drag anywhere in empty space (or click the onscreen navigation). 9 Zoom in or out of the graph with the mouse scroll wheel (or touch scroll), or click the onscreen navigation arrows. To zoom faster, you can use Alt + scroll. Reset your view at any time by clicking the Reset View circle. 10 To orbit the graph, hold down the right mouse button and drag anywhere in empty space, or click the onscreen navigation. Orbit behaves differently depending on whether you have anything selected, so let’s delve into selection. 11 Left click on a single node to select it. 12 Hold down the left mouse button, press the shift key, and drag to select a group. The Characters category in the Legend shows how many nodes you’ve selected 13 Hold down the control key to add to your selection. Left click to add a single node or hold down the left mouse button and drag to add multiple nodes. 14 Hold down the alt key to subtract from a selection. Left click to subtract a single node or use Alt + left click + drag to subtract multiple nodes. 15 In the toolbar, you can click Inverse to invert your selection. Use Ctrl+A to select all nodes in the graph space. 16 When one or more nodes are selected, the orbit controls will center on your selection. When nothing is selected, you’ll orbit the center of the graph space. 17 Click Center To to center selected nodes in the graph space and Fly Out to see all the nodes in the graph space. Click Hide to temporarily hide (not delete) selected nodes. Clear your selection by double left clicking on an empty area of the graph. 18 The Information window for any single node lets you review, edit, and even add properties of the node on the fly. Double-click on a node (or click to select a node and click the Information icon (or Ctrl + i)). 19 You can use a Table to search for nodes with specific property values. The Enhanced Table lets you directly edit a category - its label and its data. 20 Now that we’re able to navigate, let’s go on to Module 3: Properties and Extract, to use properties to create new categories and relationships.","title":"2 Loading Data","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"2-loading-data","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-learning/how-to-graphxr/2-loading-data.html","titles":[]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"In this Session…​ Before you begin…​ Inspecting properties.

Slide Text 3 When we drop Characters.csv on the graph space, columns in the spreadsheet (name, houseName, etc become properties of the nodes. For a table of the nodes and their properties, click Table on the Main Menu, and the Category label. 4 We can use a property to define a new category and relationship and extract new nodes and edges connected to the original Character nodes. 5 Let’s switch to Property view. In the Legend, click the Property tab. A dropdown menu with the first property name appears. Below it is a scrollable list of each unique value for that property in the graph. 6 The houseName property has just a few unique values, one for each of the great houses (families) in Game of Thrones. Now let’s create nodes for the Houses. Open the Transform panel => Extract tab. 7 The Transform panel includes some of GraphXR’s most powerful capabilities, letting you interactively model your data. Transforms affect the whole graph if nothing is selected. If you make a selection, a transform operates on only those elements. 8 We’ll create a House category from the houseName property, and a BELONGS_TO relationship in the process that links House nodes to their Character node sources. 9 Set houseName as a key so that a single node is created for each unique value of houseName, and not a separate one for every source node. Now click Run. 10 In the Legend, click the Category and Relationship tabs. You’ll see that a node has been created for each House, and Character nodes are now connected to a House via edges of the BELONGS_TO relationship. 11 Click the Property tab, and notice that Characters with an empty houseName property value are assigned to a House labeled not available. If you click the skip empty checkbox before extracting, those Character nodes remain unconnected. 12 This is a good time to save our work! Open the Project panel => Data tab. You can download the current state of your graph as a GraphXR (GXRF) file, export it as a group of CSVs ( or write back to a Neo4j database, if you have connected to one). 13 You can also save to the cloud by creating a View. Enter a descriptive name and click Save View. The current view is highlighted. You can load any saved view, update or delete it, and share it with another user. 14 Now that we’ve saved our progress, let’s go on to Module 4: Link and Filter and bring in more data.","title":"3 Properties and Extract","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"3-properties-and-extract","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-learning/how-to-graphxr/3-properties-and-extract.html","titles":[]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"In this Session…​ Before you begin…​ Using Link to create new edges.

It includes the number of lines and words spoken by each character in every episode of HBO’s Game of Thrones. Go ahead and zoom out—​at over 3,000 nodes, Lines.csv is a much larger dataset than Characters.csv. 5 Open the Table panel to view Lines data in a spreadsheet format. Under the Category tab click the Lines bubble and locate the speaker property. 6 With the Link transform, properties with equivalent values can be linked even if the property names are different. In the Characters category, the characterName property is equivalent to the Lines' speaker property- which lets us link characters to the number of lines they spoke on each episode. 7 Open the Transform panel => Link tab. With Link, we can create edges belonging to a new or existing relationship. Let’s link up a Characters-SPOKE-Lines pattern with characterName as the source property and speaker as the target property. Now click Run. 8 You’ll notice many Lines nodes with no connections. These correspond to lines spoken by characters who weren’t in the Characters.csv source data. Let’s clean up these extraneous nodes. 9 But first let’s save our graph state in memory using Snapshots, It lets us create a local library of graph states that can be downloaded as a .zip archive. Open the Project panel and Settings tab and click the Show Snapshot checkbox. 10 The title bar of the Snapshots dialog appears in the project space. Click the plus sign to capture a Snapshot. (Data Views are similar, but are saved to the GraphXR server). 11 Click the arrow icon on the left to show the list of snapshots you’ve taken so far. Notice that you can save your snapshots archive locally at any time. 12 Now let’s return to cleaning up our graph. We’ll use the Degree centrality algorithm to flag nodes with no connections, which we can then select and delete. In the Algorithm panel and Centrality tab, click the Degree button. 13 The algorithm writes the number of connections for each node to a new degree property. Now we can remove nodes with a degree of 0. In the Legend, click the Property tab and select degree from the dropdown menu. 14 Locate the degree value of 0, click to select those nodes and press delete (or the Delete icon in the toolbar). 15 Only nodes which have at least one connection now remain. Alternatively, you can use a Filter to accomplish the same thing. Let’s see how. 16 First, load our saved snapshot. Open the Snapshots dialog, locate the snapshot, and click the cloud icon to restore the graph that had unconnected nodes. 17 Open the Algorithm panel and the Centrality tab and click Degree to generate the degree property again. 18 Open the Filter panel. In the Node Properties menu, select the degree property. 19 Set the Max value for degree to 0 to filter out any nodes with one or more connection. Now Click Select Visible Nodes (or simply click the zero-value item in the Legend) then press delete (or the Delete toolbar icon). 20 Finally, click the filter’s trash can icon to clear the filter and show the nodes with one or more connections. 21 What’s left are the nodes that have at least one connection. Let’s take another snapshot and download the snapshot archive (or save a data View or a GXRF file). Next we’ll work with Episodes.csv in Module 5. Aggregate, Merge, and f(x).","title":"4 Link and Filter","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"4-link-and-filter","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-learning/how-to-graphxr/4-link-and-filter.html","titles":[]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"In this Session…​ Before you begin…​ Using Transforms: f(x) and Link to reformat and reorganize data.

To follow along, download the files: HowTo_05_START.graphxr and https://kineviz.com/s/GXR_QSG.zip Slide Text 3 So far, we’ve extracted a House category from the Characters.csv data, created a BELONGS_TO relationship with Character nodes, and a SPOKE relationship between Characters and the Lines they spoke. 4 Now we want to link lines of dialog with the broadcast Episodes they were spoken on. We can do this using Merge and Aggregate transforms. Drag and drop Episodes.csv onto the graph space, creating the new Episodes category and properties. 5 The Episodes.csv file contains the titles, descriptions, air dates, episode numbers, seasonnumbers, and viewership for each broadcast episode. We can now connect lines of dialog to corresponding episodes. 6 We have a little problem, though. In Lines, season and episode number are combined into the single string seasonEpisode. In Episodes, they occupy separate properties. 7 To fix this, we’ll use the Transform panel and f(x) tab. It lets us run javascript formulas on properties of a category or relationship. Presets are included, but for this we’ll need to entera custom formula. Select Episodes and episodeNumber. 8 Enter seasonEpisode as the new property name, and enter the custom formula : (propVal,props) => 'S'props.seasonNumber'E'+props.episodeNumber An example result is automatically displayed under the New Property Name. 9 Click Run. You can scroll to the bottom of the panel to view the results. 10 Now that the property values match, we can go to the Link transform. In both Episodes and Lines, select the seasonEpisode property, and click Run to link nodes with matching properties via edges of a new SPOKEN_ON relationship. 11 As we explore patterns in more detail, we can use Aggregate to add new properties to the graph and Merge to simplify and clarify the graph. 12 We want to add a totalLines property-the total number of lines spoken-to each Episode node. Lines nodes do have a lineCount property for each speaker and episode. We can use the Aggregate transform to sum those values and write the total to connected Episode nodes. 13 Go to the Transform panel and Aggregate tab (take a Snapshot first!). Under Aggregate to Category, select Episodes. Under Aggregate Along select SPOKEN_ON. Click Property from Neighbor Nodes and select lineCount. For the New Property enter totalLines, select the sum preset, and click Run. 14 We can also use Aggregate to return the number of unique characters per Episode. Select the Episodes category and SPOKEN_ON relationship. Click Property from Neighbor Nodes, and select the speaker property. Under New Property enter totalCharacters, under Formula Name select count, and click Run. 15 Now display a table to see the new totalLines and totalCharacters properties. And before we move on, create another Snapshot. Note that at any time, you can download your snapshots as a single .ZIP archive. 16 Now let’s simplify the graph using Merge. It combines nodes of a single category or the edges of a single relationship based on a property value. Go to the Transform panel and Merge tab. 17 With Merge we can use the seasonEpisode property to merge Lines nodes for an episode into a single node. Click Category and select Lines, and select seasonEpisode as the property. Click Clear Unselected Properties since only the seasonEpisode property is meaningful. 18 To simplify the graph we’ll use Merge to combine the lines nodes for an episode into a single node, using the seasonEpisode property. Click Category and select Lines, and select seasonEpisode as the key property. Click Clear Unselected Properties since only the seasonEpisode property will be meaningful. 19 Now click Run. With only one Lines node per Episode, we can now visualize the content of Episodes more clearly. But we can simplify the graph even further. In Module 6.

Click the expand/collapse arrow in the Snapshots title bar, then click snapshot’s cloud icon. 4 Now we’ll use Shortcut to create a simpler graph focused on characters and the episodes in which they have appeared. Open the Transform panel and Shortcut tab. 5 To create a shortcut, you first need to select at least one center node of an edge-node-edge pattern. Click Lines in the Legend to select all the Lines nodes. 6 Here we’ll shortcut the SPOKE-Lines-SPOKEN_ON pattern to a new APPEARED_ON relationship that will connect Characters to Episodes. We can copy properties from Lines to APPEARED_ON, but here we don’t need to. Enter the pattern and click Run. 7 We’ve now added the new APPEARED_ON relationship but our source pattern is still present.

Slide Text 3 With our .GXRF loaded, let’s explore how to set preferences controlling the display of nodes, edges and property data in our graph. You’ll find these functions in the Project panel’s Category* or *Relationship tabs or *Settings* tab. 4 To make the changes easier to see, we’ve hidden some of the Character nodes and arranged data by category in different grid and circle layouts. Open the snapshots library and load this data view now. TIP: left click+drag to move any selection of data. 5 Open the Project panel and Category tab to configure node display. The labeled bubbles at the top list the categories available in the project. Click the Characters bubble. You’ll see a list of the properties defined so far for that category. 6 The Avatar URL property checkbox lets us display an avatar image on the nodes. We’ll select the characterImage property, since we know it has URL values. NOTE: Show Avatar* in the *Settings tab must also be checked. 7 Click the Caption property checkboxes for characterName and kills properties. Captions can be either text or numerical values. By default, captions appear to the right of the node in the order you select them. NOTE: In the Settings tab, the Node Caption Position menu lets you reposition captions. 8 Click the Node Size checkbox for the kills property to display Character nodes sized according to the number of kills. (Node Size works only for a property with numerical values.) Click Exclude to hide any property so that it isn’t shown in tables or information panels. 9 In either the Category* tab or the Legend, click the colored dot for a category to display the *Styling Setting dialog where you can change the color and add an icon. 10 Let’s leave the color as it is but apply an icon to our House nodes. Click the Icon tab and use the menu or the search bar to find an icon. Click on the icon to apply it. The dialog closes automatically. 11 The icon now appears in the Legend next to the category label. You can click the dot or icon next to any element in the Legend to display the Styling Setting dialog and choose a new color or icon for a category, or color for a property or relationship. 12 You can also configure color and visibility of a category or relationship using the Project panel. Click the Relationship tab and the APPEARED_ON bubble. Click the color swatch to display a color picker and choose a different color. Click Visibility to show or hide edges of this relationship. 13 Unique property values for categories and relationships are automatically assigned separate colors, and you can change these as well. In the Legend, click the Property tab, select a property name, and click the colored dot next to a property value to select a new color. 14 Scaled color is useful for coloring property values, especially numbers or dates. In the Property legend, select the episodeAirDate property and click the Use Scale Color checkbox, and select a color set from the dropdown menu. 15 The Settings tab includes controls to configure display of all nodes and edges. Let’s go over those now. 16 For nodes you can control the base node size scale and icon mode, show or hide pin icons, show or hide Avatar urls, control caption size scale and caption position, and use the more compact Truncate Caption option. 17 For edges you can control the edge width scale, use curved lines, dashed lines or blended lines, show or hide directional arrows, and show or hide relationship names as a caption on all edges. 18 For general 3-dimensional display, the Fog Density slider makes nodes and edges that are further away appear less visible. 19 Click the Theme toggle to switch between a dark or light background for the project graph space. 20 Now click the Show Hidden Nodes toolbar icon to restore the Character nodes and their connected edges that we hid for this module. 21 We’ve already seen some of the layout options in action. Next, in Module 8. Layout and Pinning, we’ll delve into how to use layouts to explore and visualize the graph.","title":"7 Preferences","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"7-preferences","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-learning/how-to-graphxr/7-preferences.html","titles":[]},"30":{"id":30,"text":"In this Session…​ Before you begin…​ Using Layouts to organize and visualize data: Pinning and Releasing nodes Using Force directed, Parametric, Geometric,and Tree layouts. Using the Quick Layout toolbar menu for geometric layout. To follow along, download: HowTo_08START_2_14.graph…​ and the snapshot library: HowTo_08START_2_14.graph…​ Slide Text 3 As we’ve already seen, layouts can help us discover and work with graph patterns in our project. With our data loaded, let’s first click the Pin/Release toolbar icon to return to the default force-directed layout. 4 The Layout panel includes tabs to adjust the default layout appearance, to work with Geometric and hierarchical layouts, and to create Parametric 3D scatterplots. 5 In addition to detailed controls in the Layout panel, the Quick Layout toolbar icon provides a one-click menu of often-used geometric layout options. 6 We’ll delve into the various layout options in detail in a moment. First, though, we’ll look at pinning to understand how it affects working with layouts. Open the Project panel and Settings tab, and deselect Hide Pin Icon. 7 A pin icon appears on the nodes arranged with the geometric grid layout, showing that they are pinned to that xyz location in the project space. In addition, nodes that are moved manually (using left click + drag)are pinned.The number of currently pinned nodes appears on the badge next to the icon. 8 We use the Pin / Release toolbar icon to pin (or release) selected nodes. Pinned nodes are not included when you apply or adjust a force layout, and that may be what we want. But we can always release pinned nodes if desired. 9 When you select pinned nodes, the icon changes to Release. Simply click to release those nodes to the default force-directed layout. With no data selected, you can click to release (or pin) all the data. 10 To release all pinned data and return to a force layout in one click, open the Layouts panel and Geometric layout tab. Click on an empty part of the graph to de-select all data, and click the Release button. 11 Now let’s look at force-directed layout. It’s a dynamic physics simulation that arranges nodes and edges of your graph for reasonably good 3D visibility. Open the Layout panel and Force tab. Here you can adjust some of its key parameters. Adjustments affect all the data except for any pinned nodes. 12 Adjust the Link Strength slider to control how strongly the edges of the graph pull the nodes together. TIP: If the graph moves out of the view, click Center To or Fly Out toolbar icons. 13 Edge length can also be controlled by the Link Distance slider. 14 The Gravity slider controls how strongly all nodes are attracted to a central point. 15 The Charge slider adjusts how strongly nodes are attracted to each other. Moving the slider tothe left results in greater repulsive force between the nodes. 16 Use the Collision slider to separate nodes that overlap in the view. This is particularly useful in a 2D view, to un-stack nodes projected on top of one another. 17 Move the Z-Compress slider to the right to flatten the node layout so that it is more 2-dimensional. 18 A fully 2D layout can be useful, especially for reports. In the Project panel and Settings tab, click the 2D Mode checkbox. You’ll longer be able to rotate the view of the graph in 3D, and the Z-Compress slider will be hidden. 19 When you move nodes around the graph space by left click dragging them, the remaining unpinned nodes are rearranged. To prevent this, the Enable/Disable Force Layout toolbar toggle temporarily disables force layout. 20 To display nodes randomly distributed roughly within a 3D cube you can click the Enable/Disable Force Layout toggle (in the Layout panel or toolbar) then click Randomize Node Positions. Pinned nodes are not included. 21 Restore Default Settings resets slider controls to their defaults. The graph data also returns to the default force layout, again, except for any pinned nodes. Now let’s look at our other layout options. 22 The Quick Layout menu available in the toolbar lets you apply many geometric layouts in one click, and to Expand or **Contrac**t a layout by a default scale factor. 23 For example, nodes can be arranged in hierarchical rings or trees around a central selection of nodes, and we can do this from the Quick Layout menu. 24 We’ll first select the Episodes nodes and Hide them temporarily, because we just want to see Character nodes arranged around their respective House nodes. The depth of hierarchical Ring or Tree layouts can be set in the Geometric layout panel, but not in a Quick Layout. 25 Next, select the House nodes, and in the Quick Layout menu choose Circle, and then Expand, as many times as you like to expand the circle layout. (While this isn’t necessary, it will make it easier to see the Ring layout you’ll apply next.) 26 With the House nodes still selected, click Quick Layout and choose Ring from the menu. The Character nodes are now arranged in rings around their respective House nodes. NOTE: If you don’t select central nodes, GraphXR chooses for you. 27 With the House nodes still selected, choose Tree in the Quick Layout menu. The Character nodes are arranged in trees to the right of their respective House nodes. 28 Choose Ring again to return to the ring layout. Now click Show Hidden Nodes in the toolbar to restore our hidden Episode nodes. 29 We can experiment with adjusting the layout from here. For example: • Select House nodes and move them using left click + drag. • Select Episode nodes and apply a Spiral (or other) layout. • Expand or Contract any selection of nodes, or all nodes. 30 Now go to the Layout → Geometric tab and click Release to return to the default force layout. 31 The Geometric layout tab provides more layout options, controls to position nodes precisely in the project space, and the ability to order nodes by a property value. 32 As with Quick Layout we can apply a Line, Grid, Circle, Spiral, Cube, or Spring layout to any selection of nodes. But here we can also order the nodes by a property value. 33 Select our House nodes, click the Order by Property checkbox, select the House Category and houseName property, and click the Ascend (or Descend) checkbox. Now click Line. 34 In the Legend, select Episodes. Order by seasonEpisode property and click Grid. For all geometric layouts, unselected and unpinned nodes stay in force layout around the selected nodes (unless you disable force layout using the toolbar icon). 35 In the Legend, select Characters nodes, order the nodes by the kills property, and click Circle.. 36 Rotate, Scale, and Shift controls let you adjust the orientation, scale, and position of a selection in the 3D space. Select Character nodes and click Rotate Y to rotate the default 90 degrees. Select House nodes and click Expand (or Contract) to expand or contract the line layout by the default 1.5 times. 37 Select the Episodes category that’s in a grid layout and click the Shift Y button to shift the nodes up by the default 1.1 times. 38 You can enter positive or negative values for Rotate, Scale, and Shift, to reposition any selection of nodes precisely in the graph space. 39 At any time, you can choose a new layout for a selection of nodes or the entire graph. Select Characters nodes and click Cube to display the nodes in a 3D cube. 40 If no nodes are selected a geometric layout arranges all the nodes. To see this, deselect all nodes and click Spiral, then click Expand several times. 41 A Distribution layout spreads nodes grouped by a property value in the X, Y or Z direction. To illustrate, we’ll first go to the Project=>Category tab, choose Episodes and set seasonNumber as a caption. 42 Back in the Geometric layout tab, select Episodes nodes. Under Distribution, click the Spread Out checkbox and increase the Range to 6. Click Order by Property, choose seasonNumber, and click the Ascend and Number checkboxes. Finally, click X to distribute the Episodes nodes by seasonNumber along the X-axis. 43 Now click Release to return to the force layout. 44 Quick Layout uses default settings for Ring or Tree layouts. Scroll down in the Geometric tab to see that we can set the Ego depth (i.e. the number of hops from the central node), scale the edge Length, and order nodes by a property value. 45 As we did before, lay out House nodes in a circle, ordered by houseName, then Expand the circle using the Quick Layout menu_._ Again, this simply makes it easier to see the results. 46 With the House nodes still selected, scroll down to the bottom of the panel. For Ego depth, enter 1, and for the edge Length, enter 6. Click Order by Property and select Character and the kills property. Now click Ring. 47 Notice that with Ego depth set at 1, the Episodes nodes remain in force layout. 48 With House nodes still selected, click Tree. Character nodes are arranged in a tree pattern to the right of their respective House nodes. Click Left, Right, Up, or Down checkboxes and Tree again to re-orient the connected nodes. 49 Click Ring again to display our ring layout. You can also change orientation for rings (but it’s easier to see the effect in trees). 50 The rings or trees are laid out on a 2D plane, but other nodes can be positioned anywhere in the 3D project space. For example, select the Episode nodes and apply a Grid or Cube layout with nodes ordered by the seasonEpisode property. 51 At any time you can click Release to return all nodes to the default force layout. Any pinned nodes are automatically released. 52 Now open the Tree layout tab. Here you can arrange nodes as a hierarchy starting from any selection of nodes. Select House nodes and click Apply. The House nodes form the base of the tree and unselected nodes follow level by level according to their connection to the base nodes. 53 Select Episode nodes and click Apply. Now the Episode nodes form the base of the tree. This immediately separates out the many Character nodes that are not yet connected to an Episode. 54 Use the Axis slider and click Apply to scale the tree layout. To return to a force layout, click Reset. 55 Next we’ll go to the Parametric layout tab to create a 3D scatterplot. Use the X, Y, and Z dropdown menus to select properties, and click Apply. Your choices are saved, letting you apply that layout again. 56 Use the Axis slider to adjust the size of the 3D layout, and the Show Axes and Show Grid checkboxes to toggle the labeled axes and grid on and off. 57 We’ve selected properties that exist only on Episodes nodes (seasonNumber, millionViewers, and totalLines). Nodes without the properties (e.g. House or Character), or which have a null value are stacked up at the origin point. 58 To see a force layout of the nodes that don’t have the selected properties, click the Enable Force Layout toggle in the layout panel (not in the toolbar). Disable Force Layout returns us to our specified parametric layout. 59 Click Reset to return the entire graph to force layout. 60 We’ve seen how to lay out data in the project space for easier visualization and selection of graph patterns. Next, in Module 9: Time Series, we’ll look at exploring the graph by filtering on timestamp properties.","title":"8 Layout and Pinning","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"8-layout-and-pinning","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-learning/how-to-graphxr/8-layout-and-pinning.html","titles":[]},"31":{"id":31,"text":"In this Session…​ Before you begin…​ Using Filters to display and animate time series.

To visualize time series in the graph we can use parametric or geometric layouts to order nodes by date-time property values. We can also filter nodes by a date or date range. 4 First, we’ll go to Project=>Category and click Episodes. We’ll set episodeAirDate values as captions and scale the nodes by the millionViewers property value. 5 Open a Table to review episodeAirDate property values. GraphXR’s preferred format for a date and time stamp is YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss. We can edit incorrect data formats either manually or using a preset Transform. 6 If just one or a few dates are in the wrong format, you can simply edit the property value, either in the node’s Information window, or an Enhanced Table. 7 If most or all dates need reformatting, you can use a preset formula in Transform=>f(x). In the Transform panel => f(x) tab select the category (Episodes) and property (e.g. episodeAirDate) that has the date-time data you need to transform. 8 Select the toDate or convertCustomDate Input Formula. Enter a New Property Name for the converted data. A sample result appears below. Then click Test to test the transformation or Run to perform it. 9 Now open the Layout=> Parametric tab. Select episodeAirDate and millionViewers for X and Y axes and totalCharacters for the Z axis, then click Apply. Next we can apply a filter to isolate nodes with specific date property values. 10 Open the Filter panel. To filter Episode nodes by air dates (or range of air dates), select episodeAirDate in the Node Property menu. 11 You can manually scrub through the values using the handles, or use the playback controller to play through values (or a locked range). This lets us animate filtered data and share the animation with other users as a view. 12 Filters also provide effective visualization when used with the geometric or geospatial layouts that we can apply to different categories of nodes. 13 In the Geometric tab click Order by Property, select Episodes and the episodeAirDate property, click Ascend, and click Grid. You can then use Expand on the Quick Layout toolbar menu to expand the grid. 14 Now repeat the process to lay out Character nodes in a spiral, and House nodes in a line. Then, in the Legend, select both categories using ctrl+left click, and move those nodes off the grid using left click+ drag. 15 Now open the Filter panel and again select episodeAirDate in the Node Property menu to filter Episode nodes by date. Notice that we can apply multiple filters for any numerical or date property (e.g. the kills property of Character nodes). 16 Let’s filter on a range of a 2-month period. Use the handles to set a range, or click the the Min or Max fields to select a precise date and time. Select Lock Range to filter data in 2-month intervals. 17 Again, scrub through the values using the handles, or use the playback controller to play through values (or a locked range). 18 Click the trash can icon on the filters to clear them and display all the data again. 19 Next, in Module 10. Algorithms, we’ll look at how to measure graph patterns in terms of connectedness, paths, and grouping of nodes.","title":"9 Time Series","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"9-time-series","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-learning/how-to-graphxr/9-time-series.html","titles":[]},"32":{"id":32,"text":"This series of tutorials covers the basics of how to work with graph-connected data in GraphXR.

To show Add Node or Add Edge dialogs, you can click the respective toolbar icons or use the right-click menu. You can also create new properties and add their values to nodes or edges, and edit existing property values. Often, you only enter one value for a property. However, GraphXR does allow entry of multiple values for a single property. These multiple property values can be displayed as captions, on separate lines. You can also add a node without including any properties, to match a situation allowed in Neo4j. The Add Node dialog lets you add new nodes directly in GraphXR, one at a time. You can add a node of a Category by click and drag. In the Project>Category tab, click a category pill and drag to the project space to create one node. The Add Node dialog opens, and you can enter property values for the node, then click Create or Cancel. To add a node: In the context menu, click the Add Node icon to display the Add Node dialog. Use the dropdown menu to select an existing category for the added node, or enter a new category name (e.g. Pets), then press return. For example, we notice that a person owns pet dogs called Harry and Rufus. Our data doesn’t yet include anything about animal roles. For each pet, we can quickly add a node (and, for the first one, create a new Pets category with initial properties such as the name, owner, age, url image, species, breed, and colors of the pet). Enter one or more Property Names for the category (e.g. petName, etc.), and enter its corresponding Property Value (e.g. Harry) or values (e.g. black and gray). To enter multiple values, enter the first value then press return to enter the next one, and so on. OR In the list of properties for an existing category, enter a Property Value if you have one, add any additional property names and their values, and click the minus (-) icon for properties for which you have no value. The other nodes of an existing category will be updated with any new property names you add, but the values will be null. If you want to add values for a property you’ve added, you can inspect a Table for missing values, and enter a value for another node using its Information window (Ctrl+I). To enter values for multiple nodes at once, you can use f(x) or Aggregate transforms. Click Create to create the node. The new node appears in the project space. A new category will appear in the Category list in the legend. For an existing category, the total number of nodes is updated. In the Add Edge dialog you can create new edges that connect selected nodes to each other via a new or existing directed relationship. You can add properties and single or multiline property values to edges just as you can for nodes. An easy edge feature lets you select one or more nodes, then use Ctrl-drag to select a target node When the target is selected, dashed lines appear between the nodes. The Add Edge dialog opens, and you can select an existing relationship or create a new one, then click Create or Cancel. To add edges to nodes: Using any selection method, select one or more nodes that you want to connect to other nodes via a directed relationship. Click the Add Edge icon, select Add Edge from the right-click menu, or use Ctrl-drag to select a single target node. In the Add Edge dialog, either enter the name of a new relationship to be assigned to the new edges (e.g. OWNED_BY) and press return, or select an existing relationship from the dropdown menu. Optionally, enter property names and their values for the relationship. Click as Source to list the nodes that will be sources for new edges. Now select one or more target nodes for the edges and click as Target. If you’ve set the source and target backwards, click the Switch button to reverse the two. Click Create. New edges are created connecting the source nodes to the target nodes, with arrows showing the direction of the relationship. The total number of edges of that relationship is updated in the Relationship list in the legend. You can add one or more new properties to a single node or edge using the Add Property button in its Info window. Adding properties and their values to one node or edge at a time in GraphXR is impractical for large amounts of data. It can be useful for modeling and testing very small amounts of data, or for adding a small number of missing properties and their values. For example, we can add a property for a mobile number to the following Customer node that includes name and aliases properties. Captions on the customer node are currently set to show the name and the aliases. Once the mobile number property is added, we can go to the Customer category in the Project panel and Category tab and select it as a caption instead (or in addition). To add a new property and property value: Select a single node or edge and double click to display its information window. Click the Add Property button, and enter a Property Name (mobile) and one or more Property Values (a mobile number) in the provided text fields. Click Save to save the new property and property value, or Cancel to exit without saving. The information window is updated with the new property and values. Once the mobile property is added, we can set it as the caption for Customer nodes. You can edit any existing property value of a single node or edge in its Info window. This might be useful to correct an error or add missing values to a small amount of data. To edit a property value: Select a single node or edge, and in the context menu, double click to display its information window. In the list of properties, double click a property Value, and edit the value (or values) in the provided text field. The property value is updated as you enter it.

Simply locate the file on your system, then drag and drop it anywhere in the project graph space. In the Project panel and Data tab you can also click Import or Import Views to navigate to a file and import the data. Be sure to save any current view before you import data. To do this go to the project view menu and either Save your current view, or Save As a new view. If you do unintentionally import data to an existing view, you can immediately use Save As to create a new view. When you import data that has no defined graph schema, such as a flat .CSV file, each row is imported as a node of a single default category. Keep in mind that data from CSV , Excel, or .JSON files is added to any data already in the project space. To create a new empty view, save your current view, and then select New from the project view menu. This clears the existing data and opens a new empty Unsaved View. For example, the following spreadsheet can be dropped onto the project space. It’s a travel log with three columns headed date, from_country, and to_country . A node representing a single travel event is created for each row. All the nodes are assigned a single category labeled with the name of the file (i.e. COVID-19 Travel Log - Sheet1). The column headings in the file are assigned as property names: date, from_country, and to_country, and property values are transferred for the respective nodes. In the Table panel, you can inspect the imported nodes and their property values. Starting with unconnected nodes, you can create connected graph data using GraphXR’s navigation, selection, and transformation tools. In particular, the Transform panel provides powerful ways to extract and/or simplify categories, properties, and relationships. You can simply drag and drop graph data held in a JSON file, CSV or Excel archive, graphxr file, or graphxrsnapshots archive. The categories, relationships, and their properties are included. The data in graphxr files or a graphxrsnapshots archive retain the 3D layout and view perspective it had when it was saved. Keep in mind that data imported from a .graphxr view, .graphxrsnapshots archive, or data View replaces any data already in the project space. Be sure to save (or export) your current view before you import a view. You can: Use the view menu or Views tab to save your view, or Go to the Project panel and Data tab and choose Save GXRF, Save CSV, Save Excel or, if a database is connected to your project, Save Neo4j. Once a snapshot archive has been saved, you can simply restore it to your project by drag and drop. To import a snapshot archive: Open a GraphXR project. Locate the .graphxrsnapshots archive file, and drag and drop it on your project’s graph space. The set of snapshots appear in the Snapshots window, and the most recent snapshot is imported to the graph space. Existing data if any is replaced with the most recent snapshot view. You can import any of the snapshots in the archived set as your new starting point. Click the arrow on the left edge of the Snapshots window to expand the archive and locate the snapshot you want. Click the snapshot’s cloud icon to import it. When you exit or log out, snapshots are deleted.

The data is modeled according to the current database schema, that is, the categories, relationships, and properties which have been defined so far. There are several ways to import Neo4j data into your project : Pull nodes or edges 25 at a time by selecting a category or relationship in the respective tab in the Project panel and clicking Pull. Pulling data is designed for quick initial exploration. Specific database search or query, combined with the Expand function yields more complete and focused results. Use the search bar to enter a full text keyword search of indexed node properties and import the results from the database. Once some data have been imported, you can use Expand to import additional data connected by specified relationships to nodes that are already the graph. Enter and run a Cypher query in the Cypher tab of the Query panel to import data that match specific graph patterns. You can pull 25 nodes at a time from a category or relationship that appears in the Category or Relationship tab of the Project panel. To pull data by Category: Click the Project panel icon and Category tab. Click one of the Category items to select it. Click Pull to pull 25 nodes associated with that category, and any edges that connect the nodes. For added samples, click again, as many times as you want. To pull data by relationship: Click the Project panel icon and Relationship tab. Click one of the Relationship items to select it. Click Pull to pull 25 edges associated with that relationship, the connected nodes, and all the other edges connected to those nodes. For added samples, click again, as many times as you want. The search field at the top right corner of the graph space provides full-text keyword search of either the data already in the project space or in a connected database. You use the icon at the right of the search field to toggle between Searching from Database or Searching from Graph. To search a Neo4j database, the search terms must first be indexed in the database. The Config Search Index icon to the right of the database icon opens the configuration dialog. To configure the search index: Click the gear icon next to the search bar to display the the Database Text Search Index Configuration dialog. The dialog lists the categories in the connected database and their properties. Click Refresh Property to make sure all the properties in the database are listed. Select properties you want to index. You can either Click the All Category Properties checkbox to select all properties. OR Click checkboxes to index selected properties. Click Submit Index Task to index the database search terms. A message displays indicating that the indexing task was successful. Click the X at the upper right to close the dialog. To import data using full-text keyword search: Enter one or more search terms in the search bar at the top left corner of the graph space, and press return. You can search for exact indexed property values or partial text strings. Use asterisks to define a search for partial property values (e.g. *Jo** for **Jo**hn, **Jo**nathan, **Jo**sephine). Position asterisks to search for values that start with, end with, or contain the specified string (e.g. **Jo*, *Jo**, or **Jo**). Terms separated by a space use OR logic. Nodes with indexed property values matching any one of the terms will be returned. (e.g. Inspector Sergeant for nodes that include an exact property value of Inspector OR Sergeant). Terms separated by the word AND return only nodes with indexed property values that match all terms. (e.g. Inspector AND D** for nodes with an exact property value of Inspector, and a property value that starts with D (case-insensitive). Search results are listed beneath the search bar for each category. Nodes matching the search keyword appear below the search field listed by category, in alphabetical order. Click the arrow to the left of a category to view individual nodes. If more than five nodes are returned for a category, use the arrow selector at the right to navigate through the list and locate nodes you want to import. Click a list item to add the node to the graph space. OR Click the + icon to the right of the category label to import all the matching nodes of that category. When you add data, the nodes remain selected in the graph space until you add more data. If you want to immediately remove the data you just imported, press delete while the nodes are still selected. Click the X in the search bar to clear the search and return to the graph space. Once data are imported, you can click the toggle to the right of the search bar to switch to a search of the graph. Searching in the graph can help quickly focus a search, since matching nodes are actively highlighted as you enter search terms. However, a graph search works differently than a database search in that: Partial text is entered without asterisks AND logic is not recognized. Any space between search terms is still recognized as OR logic. The Expand icon in the context toolbar menu lets you import additional data from the database which is connected to a selected node or group of nodes already in your project space. To import data using Expand: Select one or more nodes in the graph space, then click Expand in the toolbar or right-click context menu to display the Expand with relationships dialog. Click the checkbox next to a relationship name to import nodes connected by that relationship as well as the edges. OR Click All to pull nodes and edges that have any relationship to the selected nodes. To limit the number of nodes, enter a number in the Limit field. Set additional options for expanding the graph: Click the Only among selected nodes checkbox to expand relationships only for the selected nodes. Specify Directional relationships using the dropdown menu. You can choose All directions, only nodes connected by relationships From the selected nodes, To the selected nodes, or only those with a Bidirectional relationship. Increase Repeat relationship times, which automatically repeats the expand operation, enabling you to pull in the limit of 1000 edges repeatedly. Click the Expand button. An Expand Next Page dialog indicates the number of items successfully expanded. You can: Click Expand More to pull the next 1000 connected items. This lets you pull in all the data in the database that have the specified connections without needing to return to the Expand with relationships dialog. Click Cancel (or simply click the X at the upper right) to close the dialog. Additional nodes and their relationships are pulled into the graph. In the example below, All relationships were selected, and additional nodes with edges connected to the selected Character and House nodes were pulled from the Neo4j database. Once no additional connected nodes are found, a message displays that all relationships are expanded. Cypher is a query language for graph data developed by Neo4j which has become a standard for querying graph databases. Cypher can be used to return graph data that match a specified graph pattern, and also to perform complex data selection, transformation, and analytics, as well as graph database maintenance. For information about Cypher, refer to Neo4j’s For Beginners - Cypher Query language and the Neo4j Cypher Manual. In GraphXR’s Query panel and Cypher tab you can: Enter a Cypher query and click the play icon on the right to run it. Save and name a query by clicking the + (plus) icon. The saved query appears on a dropdown menu. Run a saved query by selecting it on the dropdown and clicking the play icon. All GraphXR projects include a basic query that pulls 100 connected nodes from the database. This query will MATCH any pattern of nodes n and m connected by any relationship r, and RETURN the first 100 found. The LIMIT is set because this query will likely return a large amount of data. MATCH (n)-[r]-(m) RETURN * LIMIT 100 A more specific, but still basic query for categories and relationships of interest is the following query for Game of Thrones data with the pattern (Characters)-[belongs_to]-(House). This query will MATCH any pattern of Characters and House nodes connected by a belongs_to relationship and RETURN all the matching graph patterns. The variables c, r, and h are used here to simplify further query specifications. MATCH (c:Characters)-[r:belongs_to]-(h:House) RETURN * To import data using a Cypher query: Click to open the Query panel icon. The Cypher tab is displayed.

The Query panel and SQL tab enables you to run SQL queries and model the results as graph data. You can: Connect to a database through MySQL, MSSQL, or PostgreSQL and run a valid query. Save queries for re-use in the project. Load the table of results to the graph, either without further modeling, or by applying a mapping, just as you would a CSV file. Query results can only be loaded to the graph if they are returned as a table of values with column headings. Not all SQL queries return such results. To run a SQL query and import the results: Click the Query panel icon and SQL tab. Enter connection details: Click one of the checkboxes to choose the query environment: MySQL, MSSQL, or PostgreSQL. Enter the Server, UserName, Password, and Database name. Click Test Connection. A message indicates that the connection has been established, or indicates a problem. As long as the SQL query panel remains open, multiple queries can be run without re-entering connection details or re-testing the connection. Once the database connection is established, enter a query and click the Run arrow. For example, you can enter SHOW TABLES to see a list of the tables in the database. Enter a suitable query. In the example below, we’ll simply return all the values in one of the database tables. The results appears below the query window. Optionally, click the + icon to save the query. You can now either: Click Load Without Mapping. This creates a single category (e.g. employees), with a node for each row of the table and properties created from the column headings. Select a Mapping from the dropdown menu and click Apply. A mapping is essentially a graph schema that defines columns in a table as categories, properties, and key values, and defines connecting relationships. When applied, nodes and edges in the specified graph pattern, and with the specified properties are created and loaded to the project. Use the Mapping Editor to create a New mapping or Edit an existing one. You can also import a mapping saved from another project.","title":"Import SQL Query Results","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"import-from-sql","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-user/data-import/import-from-sql.html","titles":[]},"53":{"id":53,"text":"GraphXR’s Mapping Editor lets you map data in a single CSV file (or table of SQL query results) to a graph pattern or model. You can map just the data you want; you need not import the entire table. A mapping queries the data of interest and converts it to graph data, assigning the categories, properties, relationships, and key values you specify. You can: Map a table column as a static Category or Relationship label, map additional columns as properties, and create nodes and edges according to properties set as key values. Map the values within a table column as dynamic Category or Relationship labels. This maps unique values within the column to separate Categories (or Relationships) and creates nodes and edges accordingly. This can help you visualize changes in data that’s updated periodically. To create a dynamic mapping, you enter a column name in curly braces { } in the Mapping Editor’s Category Name or Relationship Name field. To make the labels more readable, additional text can be included both before and after the name (e.g. Text{Column Name}_MoreText_). For example, the mapping shown above helps to visualize and work with photo assets by location and author, since separate categories are created for unique values found in PlaceName and Provider columns. Separate TAKEN_BY relationships (e.g. TAKEN_BY_Provider 1, TAKEN_BY_Provider 2) are also defined for unique values in the Provider column. Now each author’s connection to images is displayed in a separate color, which rapidly highlights authorship in the graph. Once you create a mapping, you can: Save, apply, and edit the mapping. Export a saved mapping as a .JSON file. You can include this with the original data, and import it to other GraphXR projects. Data mapping is available in both the CSV and SQL tabs of the Query panel. The result of a SQL query must be in the form of a table with column headings in order for mapping to be possible. We’ll start with an example CSV file that contains a table (with headers) of photographic images and associated metadata such as photographer, image ID, size, date taken, keywords and ratings, and location (place names and latitude-longitude). Using static and dynamic mapping, we can design a model to connect location, ratings and authors of photographic images. We’ll create Image, Rating, and Author categories and map appropriate properties from the CSV as follows: Image can include the pkey (since we have one), photo ID number, name, url, image size, date taken, provider, copyright, place name, latitude and longitude, state, and country. Rating can include Rating. Author can include Provider. We’ll also map dynamic relationships as: RATED_AT{Rating}_ to connect Image and Rating nodes with edges labeled by Rating. TAKEN_BY{Provider}_ to connect Image and Author nodes with edges labeled by Provider. Mapping data from a table in a SQL relational database uses the same mapping editor interface. To create a mapping: In the Query panel, open the CSV tab, click Load CSV, navigate to your CSV file, and click Open. Notice that the Mapping Editor is only available once you have loaded your CSV file. The file name and number of rows and columns are displayed next to the Load CSV button. The contents of the file including its column headings are displayed in a data table, 10 records at a time. Below that are the controls to create, update and apply a mapping and to access saved mappings. A mapping is applied to the CSV file that’s loaded. You can load a different CSV and apply a saved mapping to it if it also includes the column headings and properties specified in the mapping. Scroll to the bottom of the panel, and click New to display the Mapping Editor. The Mapping Editor window is divided into left and right functional areas: On the left, you add categories and relationships, and save or export your mapping. On the right, you enter a Category Name (or Relationship Name), inspect Sample Data from the CSV, and specify the Properties to be mapped from the CSV ColumnName to a PropertyName for the current category or relationship. The first category, shown as a circular icon labeled Category1, is automatically created and selected. On the right, in CategoryName, change the label to Image. A standard naming convention for categories and relationships will make mappings and your graph data more readable. For example, capitalize category names (Image), and use upper case with words separated by underscore characters for relationship names (TAKEN_AT). Now add properties for the Image category. From the Sample Data area, click the + (plus) icon next to columns to be included as properties. Each column name appears in the Properties list as you add it. A property will be named as in the CSV file, but you can enter a different name. If you add a property by mistake, simply click its trash can icon in the Remove column. Click the AsKey checkbox to set one or more properties as key values. In this example, we set the pkey_photo property as the key. This ensures that there will be only one node for each unique photo. Notice that you can set AsKey for more than one property, which provides flexibility in how you define unique entities in your mapping. We’ll add a second Rating category connected to the Image category. Roll over the Image icon, click in the purple highlighted area, and drag to add a new category and relationship. Select the new category icon, and change its Category Name to Rating. The relationship now appears as a directed arrow with a default Image_Category1 name. Click to add the Rating column from the CSV as a property, and click to set it AsKey so that there will be a single node for each unique rating. Add a third Author category connected to the Image category. Roll over the Image icon, click in the purple highlighted area, and drag to add the new category and relationship. Select the new icon and change its Category Name to _ Author_ . Click to add the Provider column as a property, rename it to authorName, and click AsKey so that there will be a single node for each unique photographer. The Add Category and Add Edge icons at the upper left let you add categories and connect them to relationships separately rather than in one step. This can make it easier to model specific directional relationships. Now edit the relationship names and specify dynamic relationships. Click the Image_Category1 relationship and change its Relationship Name to RATED_AT{Rating}. Optionally, properties can be added to the relationship, but here we don’t need to. Click the Image_Category2 relationship and change its Relationship Name to TAKEN_BY{Provider}_. A name you enter in the curly braces must exactly match the column header name in the CSV. If the Mapping Editor can’t match the name (for example, because it is misspelled), the relationship will be created but will be labeled \"undefined\". Click any category or relationship icon to review and make any changes. Click the Save As icon in the Mapping Editor window. In the dialog box, enter a name in the Save As text field, and click OK. The name appears in the Mapping dropdown menu. Click Apply to apply the mapping to the loaded file and import the mapped data. GraphXR queries the CSV, maps the data, and loads it to the project space. You can edit the mapping at any time and Save it, or use Save As to edit and save as a new mapping. A CSV will still be loaded, so during the editing process, a mapping can easily be edited and then re-applied. To edit a mapping: Open the CSV tab in the Query panel, click Load CSV, navigate to the CSV file associated with the mapping, and click Open. Select the mapping you want to edit from the Mapping dropdown menu and click Edit. Edit, add or delete categories, relationships, and their properties. Click either the Save As icon to save your work as a new mapping, or the Save and Exit icon to save to the existing mapping. To exit the editor without saving changes, click the X at the upper right of the Mapping Editor window. You can export a mapping as a JSON file, and then re-import it whenever you want. It is good practice to export mappings before you exit a project. To export a mapping as a JSON file: Open the CSV tab in the Query panel, click Load CSV, navigate to the CSV file associated with the mapping, and click Open. Select the mapping in the dropdown menu, and click Edit to open the Mapping Editor. Click the Export Schema icon at the top left. A JSON file for the mapping is written to your local machine. To import a mapping saved as a JSON file: Open the CSV tab in the Query panel, click Load CSV, navigate to the CSV file associated with the mapping, and click Open. Click Import, navigate to the JSON file, and click Open. The mapping appears in the Mapping menu. Select the mapping and click Apply to map the loaded CSV data. If you choose a mapping that was not defined on the CSV file you loaded, the following message displays: \"Mapping not compatible with the data.\" You can delete any or all of the mappings at any time. To delete a mapping: Open the CSV tab in the Query panel. Select the mapping you want to delete from the Mapping menu and click Delete.","title":"Import using the Mapping Editor","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"import-using-a-mapping","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-user/data-import/import-using-a-mapping.html","titles":[{"text":"Creating a Mapping","hash":"_creating_a_mapping","id":1},{"text":"Editing a mapping","hash":"_editing_a_mapping","id":2},{"text":"Exporting or Importing a mapping","hash":"_exporting_or_importing_a_mapping","id":3},{"text":"Deleting a mapping","hash":"_deleting_a_mapping","id":4}]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"Once a view has been saved, you can load it into the project at any time.

This saves both the graph data and its 3D layout. Since there are many actions you cannot easily revert, you must save any state of the graph that you may want to revisit, such as the results of transformation, simplification, or layout. Moreover, all data in the project space is deleted when you leave the project or log out. There are essentially two ways to save your graph data: A data View, which is uploaded to the server such that it persists in the project until you delete it. Saved views are displayed in the Project panel and Views tab, and in a compact views menu at the top center of the project space. A Snapshot, which is saved locally, but does not persist when you exit the project. Saved snapshots appear in a separate Snapshots pane. To display it, go to the Project panel and Settings tab and click Show Snapshots. If you only need an image of the data layout and the legend, but not the live graph data, you can download a .png screenshot or an SVG file. For a screenshot, click Take Screenshot on the toolbar or Project > Data tab, or Screenshot on the right-click menu. For an SVG file, click Export SVG on the Project > Data tab. The screenshot or SVG file is labeled with the project name, and saved in the location set in your system preferences (such as Downloads). A data View is a named GXRF file uploaded to the server. Once saved, a view persists in a project until you delete it. Saved data views are available to any user of the project. Individual views can also be shared with users even if they do not have access to the project. You can export a view to your local system as a GXRF file, and from there load it into a different project as a new view. However, it is usually better to share views. The Project > Views panel displays your saved views as thumbnail previews or a list, and provides options to find and load views, as well as to create, update, share, and delete them. Views created in previous versions of GraphXR remain available, but do not include a thumbnail preview. You can: Save the data in the graph to the last view you loaded, or use Save As to save the data as a new view. Load a view by clicking its thumbnail preview or list item. Find a view using the list or the thumbnail previews. To narrow your search you can: Sort views by Name, Date Modified, or Date Created, in either ascending or descending order. The Date Modified timestamp is displayed in the list, and also in the view’s information panel. Filter views by name. You can enter all or part of a view name in the filter search bar. To clear the filter, you must delete your search input. Share, rename, or delete a view by clicking icons on the thumbnail or list. Display an information panel to see the number of nodes and edges, date the view was created and date last modified, and to review or add remarks. The view menu at the top of the project space near the legend displays the current project and the name of the last view you loaded. An asterisk appears next to the name if the view has been modified since it was loaded (for example, by adding or deleting data, or simply re-positioning the data). In the view menu you can also: Select New to clear the graph and flag the project space as an empty Unsaved View. This action is only available on the views menu. Select and load a view by name either from a list of recent views sorted by the date last modified, or all views sorted alphabetically. Select Share to share the current view. Snapshots let you save a set of up to ten (10) graph states in memory, re-load them, and save and re-load the collection of views as an archive at any time.

Click the Use Scale Color checkbox, and choose a color scale from the additional dropdown menu. In the example above, the BuPu scale colors visible Character nodes according to their kills property value, on a gradient with a lowest value assigned a pale blue, and the highest a dark purple. All nodes of the category or tag are colored, whether selected or not. Hidden nodes are colored as soon as they are restored to the graph space. A category, property, or tag can include an icon as well as a color. You select an icon using the Legend and Styling Setting dialog, in the same way you select a color. You can search for an icon by name, or use the dropdown menu to select general types of icons. Icons are colored with your current color choice and icon mode. To change the coloring mode for icons, go to the Project -> Settings and Icon Mode menu at the bottom of the panel. To select an icon for a Category: Go to the Legend and click the Category tab. Locate the Category in the list and click the colored dot at the right. This displays the Styling Setting dialog. Click the Icon tab to display the icon picker. To locate icons, you can Search by name (e.g. “_home_”). Use the dropdown menu to display groups of similar icons. Click to select an icon for the category. The new icon is applied to all the nodes of the category, colored with your current color choice and mode, and the dialog closes. In the Styling Setting dialog for a category or relationship you can select one or more properties of a category or relationship whose values will be used as captions on those nodes or edges. The caption for each property you select is displayed on a separate line. Captions appear when the node or edge is close enough to your virtual viewpoint, and disappear when you navigate further away. You can also go to the Projects panel and Category or Relationship tab and use Caption checkboxes in the lists of properties of a category or relationship to select captions. Often a property will have just one value, but multi-line property values are also supported, and are displayed in captions. A property with more than one value will appear with each value on a separate line. The Projects panel and Settings tab provides options to set the global display of captions: Auto Caption checkbox automatically applies a default caption property (caption>label>title>name) if the user hasn’t selected one for that category. Alternate Caption Rendering checkbox displays captions using an alternate rendering that may be more legible than the default rendering at very small text sizes. However, the number of captions which can be rendered at a time is limited. Show Relationship Name checkbox displays the relationship name on every edge. Caption Size Scale slider lets you adjust the global text size of captions. Node Caption Position dropdown menu lets you adjust the position of captions on nodes. Position options are Right, Top (left-aligned or centered), Bottom (left-aligned or centered), and Vertical. To apply captions: In the legend, click the colored dot or line next to a category or relationship to show the Styling Setting dialog. Click the Caption tab. From the dropdown menu, select the properties to be applied as captions on the nodes (or edges). If you select more than one property, the caption displays in the order you add the properties to the list in the Styling Setting dialog, or select properties using the Caption checkboxes in the Project panel. For example, a caption with the Episode's property values selected in order of season, episode, and title appears as follows:","title":"Setting Colors, Icons, and Captions","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"color-icon-and-captions","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-user/display-options/color-icon-and-captions.html","titles":[{"text":"Selecting a color","hash":"_selecting_a_color","id":1},{"text":"Selecting a color scaled by a property value","hash":"_selecting_a_color_scaled_by_a_property_value","id":2},{"text":"Selecting an icon","hash":"_selecting_an_icon","id":3},{"text":"Applying captions to nodes or edges","hash":"_applying_captions_to_nodes_or_edges","id":4}]},"62":{"id":62,"text":"A template lets you preserve project settings and and apply them to any of your projects.

You connect visual blocks that represent category, relationship, and property values to form a graph pattern, automatically generate a Cypher query, and run it. Once you’ve run the query, you can use the In-Memory Search function to find and select patterns in the returned data. You can enter and run any Cypher query in GraphXR’s Query panel. But with Visual Query Builder, you can start using Cypher’s most useful graph pattern-matching functions right away, which lets you explore your graph data much more quickly and easily. To quickly connect Neo4j with GraphXR, download Neo4j Desktop and follow the steps to add GraphXR as a graph app onto Neo4j. Cypher, developed by Neo4j, is a query language for selecting, presenting, and transforming graph data, and for managing a graph database. Visual Query Builder focuses on Cypher’s capability to match patterns and return data as nodes and edges. This type of Cypher query is generally structured as follows: Cypher Description MATCH (a:Category) - [b: RELATIONSHIP] -> (c:Category) …​etc. Match (i.e., find) specified graph patterns, usually based on category labels and relationship labels and directions. Multiple MATCH statements can be used to query for branched patterns. Note: Although you can specify property values in a MATCH statement, a WHERE clause is usually used. WHERE a.PropertyName1 = Value AND …​etc. Qualifiers based on property values in the specified nodes and edges. To match values, Visual Query Builder provides Equals, Greater Than, Less Than, Like, or In operators. RETURN * LIMIT 25 Return matching nodes and edges, optionally limiting the number of nodes returned. To learn and use additional Cypher capabilities such as specifying ranges of values, returning property data as tables or lists, merging or parsing data, creating new nodes and edges, and managing and tuning query performance, see Neo4j’s free learning resources, including: Cypher Classroom training, Cypher Online training, and Hands-on in Sandbox guides (use command :play cypher) A basic Cypher query on the Neo4j open source Movie database is shown below. It finds patterns where a Person node whose name property value includes “Tom” has ACTED_IN a Movie, and returns the first 25 found: MATCH (a:Person)-[b:ACTED_IN]-(e:Movie) MATCH (a:Person)-[d:DIRECTED]-(e:Movie) WHERE a.name =~ \".Tom.\" RETURN * LIMIT 25 To build this query in Visual Query Builder, you use Person and Movie Category blocks and connect them through sockets to an ACTED_IN Relationship block. You then specify the name property by connecting a Property block to the Person Category block through property sockets, as shown below: Once you’ve built a query, you can copy it to the clipboard, and paste it into GraphXR’s Query panel and Cypher tab. This enables you to save, edit, and even extend your query by using additional Cypher functions not available in Visual Query Builder. Cypher query capabilities such as CREATE or MERGE are only available if the correct user privileges are set in Neo4j. Visual Query Builder provides the workspace and building blocks to build and run a Cypher query (or In-Memory Search) for graph patterns based on categories, relationships, and their properties. You can: Build and run a Cypher query: Click a Category, Relationship, or Property building block to add it to the workspace, select its available specifications, and connect the building blocks using the provided sockets. You can query for patterns in just one category of nodes, or one that links any number of categories and directed relationships. Click the Cypher Query block at any time to see the query being built. In its Limit field, you can edit the number of nodes to return. When the query is built, click its run arrow to run the query. Modify an existing query. Use In Memory Search to find and highlight subgraphs in the returned data. Export and import visual queries as JSON files. We’ll build visual queries on the Neo4j Movies database available through the GraphXR demo project VQB Movies. It includes Person, Movie, and Distributor categories, linked by relationships including ACTED_IN, DIRECTED, and REVIEWED. To explore the project, log in, go to the Project>Data tab, and load a saved data view. A simple pattern is one that looks for specific nodes of only one category. The following example shows a query for Person nodes whose name property includes “Tom”. To build a visual query on a single category: Log in to GraphXR, and click to open the VQB Movies Demo project. In the Projects panel and Extensions tab select Visual Query Builder from the dropdown menu. Click the Cypher Query block to add it to the workspace and view the query as it’s being built. You can add the Cypher Query block at any time. Click a Category block to add it to the workspace, click its settings icon, and select the Person label. We’ll query for a specific name, so click its name property and click OK. Now click to add a Property block. We use it to specify the name of a person (e.g. “Tom”). Click and drag to connect its socket to the name socket on the Person block. On the Property block, select Like from the dropdown menu, and enter Tom. Click the run arrow on the Cypher Query block. Four matching Person nodes are returned to the project space. A more complicated pattern can specify more than one category and their properties, as well as multiple relationships of interest. The following example shows a query for Person nodes with a name that includes “Tom”, who ACTED_IN a Movie that was released after 1990. To build a visual query for multiple category and relationship patterns: Open Visual Query Builder. Click the Cypher Query block to add it to the workspace so that you can view the query as it’s being built. You can add the Cypher Query block at any time. Click two category blocks and a relationship block to add them to the workspace. Click the settings icons on the category blocks and set them as follows: Person, with the name property selected, then click OK. Movie , with the released property selected, then click OK. If you are starting from the previous simple query, just add one more category block. Click the settings icon on the relationship block, and set it to ACTED_IN. Click and drag between the white sockets to connect the category and relationship blocks. Click to add two Property blocks, and click and drag to connect their property sockets as follows: To the name socket on the Person category block (if not already connected). Then select Like from the dropdown menu and enter Tom. To the released socket on the Movie category block. Then select Greater than from the dropdown menu, and enter 1990. Click the run icon on the Cypher query block. If the query does not load, or returns unexpected results, see Troubleshooting. You can save and share a visual query by exporting (or importing) it as a .JSON file. When you re-enter a project after exiting, you can then re-load the visual query into Visual Query Builder. This also lets you share a visual query with another user. To save a visual query: Click the Export icon at the top of the building blocks list. A .JSON file is exported to your system and appears in your browser’s Downloads tab. To import a visual query: Open the Visual Query Builder, and in the building blocks panel, click the Import icon at the top of the building blocks list. Navigate to the .JSON file (typically, in your Downloads), select it and click Open to import it to the workspace. You can click the document icon at the lower right of the Cypher Query block to copy the Cypher query to the clipboard. Unlike .JSON export, this copies the Cypher query but does not preserve the visual building blocks. This can still be useful if you want to edit or extend a query quickly in GraphXR. From the clipboard, you can paste the query (Ctrl+V)into GraphXR’s Query>Cypher panel. Click the plus icon to save the query before you edit it further. Once you’ve built and run a visual query you can continue to add and connect more building blocks, or remove blocks by dragging them to the Trash can icon at the lower right. The query in the Cypher Query block is immediately updated. To delete an entire query and start over with an empty workspace, click the Clear icon located to the right of the Export icon at the top of the building blocks panel. Once graph data have been returned to GraphXR, you can also find and select subgraphs. Simply build (or import) a visual query and use In Memory Search, instead of the Cypher Query block. Subgraphs can be single nodes, as in this query for any Twitter user with a screen_name like “Jeff”…​ or connected nodes, as in this query for influential users connected through a specific RETWEETED relationship: The nodes returned to the search list are labeled with the caption you set in the GraphXR Project>Category panel. This may be (but isn’t necessarily) the property name you used in the query pattern. You can change the caption at any time. To run an In-Memory Search: In this example a node for each county in the United States has been imported to the GraphXR project space. To query for the counties in a particular state, we first click the In-Memory Search block to add it to the workspace. Increase the value in the Limit field to return more than the default 5 subgraphs. Click the run arrow at the top right of the block. A list of matching nodes is displayed. Click an item on the list to select the node or pattern in the graph space. Or, click Select All to select all the patterns on the list. With the data selected, other GraphXR functions can be used. For example, you can Tag a selection, or use Inverse to select and then temporarily Hide or Delete all the other data. Example visual queries were built on Twitter data collected for Kineviz' Elections 2020 project. In addition to Twitter Users, this Neo4j database includes: Tweets and the Media tweeted. RETWEETED relationships were created between Users for several months of the 2020 US election cycle. Additional generated properties including User properties such as gender, age, race, language used, and the probability that the user is a bot, as well as Tweet properties such as flags for fake news and hate speech. This query is for influential Twitter users who are probably bots and who have retweeted to other influential users in a particular month. In the Neo4j graph data connection is through relationships of the form RETWEETED_YYYY_MM. Influential bot users are those with a followers_count property value greater than 20,000 and a boto_prob (i.e. calculated probability) of 0.90 or greater. Since graph data is often used to model complex connections (for example between people or ideas, time series, or spatial patterns), it can be interesting focus on chains of connected nodes. We can query for such a pattern by setting a length in the settings of a Relationship block. The length setting provides a dropdown menu and text boxes for entering a number: equal. Enter a whole number. Returns nodes connected via up to that number of the specified edge. (e.g. enter '3' to return nodes with 1, 2, or 3 of the specified connections). greater than. Enter a whole number. Returns nodes with that number or greater of connections via the specified edge. (e.g. enter '3' to return nodes with 3 or more of the specified connections) between - Two text boxes appear. Enter the lower and higher number to return nodes with that range of the specified edges. (e.g. enter 2-5 to return nodes with 2, 3, 4, or 5 of the specified edge.) On the Twitter data, we could query for Users who retweeted to one another during September 2020 (i.e., with the relationship RETWEETED_2020_09) and are 3 to 5 hops to other Users via that relationship. The Cypher query now includes the length in the MATCH statement as a property of the relationship, as follows: MATCH (a:User)-[b:RETWEETED_2020_09*3..5]->(c:User) To…​ Action Add a block to the workspace. Click the block. Move a block. Click and drag. Connect a block. Click a socket and drag the line to another socket. Disconnect a block. Click the socket a line is connected TO, and drag the line off. Delete a block or query. Click and drag to the Trash can. Clear the workspace of all blocks and queries. Click the Clear (brush) icon at the upper left side of the block selector panel. Set a Category or Relationship label. Click the settings icon on the Category or Relationship block and select a label. Set a Relationship direction. Click the settings icon on a Relationship block, click the Advanced dropdown, then the Select Direction menu and select Right. Specify a Property value. Click the dropdown menu on the Property block to select an operator (Equals, Greater Than, Less Than, Like, or In) and enter the value in the text box. Run a visual Cypher query. Click the run arrow on the Cypher Query block. Run an In-Memory Search After running a visual query in the workspace, click the In-Memory Search block and its run arrow. Export a visual query. Click the Export icon at the top left of the block selector panel. Import a visual query. Click the Import icon at the top left of the block selector panel, navigate to the .JSON file and click to open. Zoom in or out on the workspace. Use the mouse wheel. Reposition the entire visual query. Click on the workspace and drag. Dismiss the block selector panel. Click the X icon at the upper right of the panel. Display Visual Query Builder as a split screen or a full screen. Click the Split Screen or Full Screen icon at the upper right of the Extensions panel. While building a query, you can click the split screen or full screen icons at any time to expand the workspace. Display Visual Query Builder in a separate window. Click the Airplane icon at the upper right of the Extensions panel. The query you are building will persist, and will also persist if you close the separate window and re-open Visual Query Builder in the Extensions panel. Issue Possible Resolution An error message indicates that a connection to the server was not established. Most likely, the Cypher query is not well-formed. Check that you’ve actually connected the blocks, entered valid property values, and that the query has a valid number for the LIMIT. The query loads but does not return any results. If a query does not return results, but you know that matching data exist in the database, verify that entries for property values are spelled correctly, and that you have chosen the correct Property operator: • Greater Than and Less Than operators accept only numerical values • Like accepts text strings. • Equals and In accepts either text strings or numerical values. The values will be matched exactly. Equals accepts a single value. For In, you can enter a list of comma-separated values (no leading space, no quotes). Spaces after a comma are ignored (i.e. right,left,up,down returns the same results as right, left, up, down). While you can specify many patterns using Visual Query Builder, some Cypher pattern matching functionality is not currently implemented, including: OR syntax in MATCH or WHERE statements. The path variable in a MATCH statement. It refers to an entire pattern, which lets you refer to a complex set of connections as a single entity, and then apply property specifications to filter only those paths that qualify. Ranges of values in a WHERE statement (for example: a.property > 100 < 1000). Currently there is one socket for each property value, for which one operator can be selected.","title":"Visual Query Builder","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"visual-query-builder","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-user/graphxr-extensions/visual-query-builder.html","titles":[{"text":"Cypher and Pattern Matching","hash":"_cypher_and_pattern_matching","id":1},{"text":"Patterns Visual Query Builder can match","hash":"_patterns_visual_query_builder_can_match","id":2},{"text":"From Visual Query to Cypher","hash":"_from_visual_query_to_cypher","id":3},{"text":"Building Visual Queries","hash":"_building_visual_queries","id":4},{"text":"Build a query on a single Category","hash":"_build_a_query_on_a_single_category","id":5},{"text":"Build a query on a multiple Categories, Relationships, and properties","hash":"_build_a_query_on_a_multiple_categories_relationships_and_properties","id":6},{"text":"Saving and sharing a Visual Query","hash":"_saving_and_sharing_a_visual_query","id":7},{"text":"Editing a Visual Query","hash":"_editing_a_visual_query","id":8},{"text":"Using In Memory Search","hash":"_using_in_memory_search","id":9},{"text":"Case Study: Visual Queries for Social Media Research","hash":"_case_study_visual_queries_for_social_media_research","id":10},{"text":"Query on Influential Twitter Users","hash":"_query_on_influential_twitter_users","id":11},{"text":"Query for linkage between nodes","hash":"_query_for_linkage_between_nodes","id":12},{"text":"Visual Query Builder Quick Reference","hash":"_visual_query_builder_quick_reference","id":13},{"text":"Troubleshooting Visual Queries","hash":"_troubleshooting_visual_queries","id":14},{"text":"Common Issues","hash":"_common_issues","id":15},{"text":"Visual Query Builder Limitations","hash":"_visual_query_builder_limitations","id":16}]},"68":{"id":68,"text":"You can export: All the graph data in the project space as a CSV archive of flat files or Excel workbook.

A GraphXR project provides a virtual 3D space for viewing and working with such graph patterns. Visualizing patterns in terms of both direction and multi-hop connections can quickly provide insight that is difficult or impossible to discover in tables or hierarchical data structures. And a graph data model can be easily extended and modified. GraphXR supports a labeled property graph model, in which patterns are composed of three elements: nodes, edges, and properties. Nodes are entities, such as people or events. All nodes of a given type comprise a Category with a single label, such as Location that identifies it in GraphXR. Each node appears in a GraphXR project as a circle, colored and styled according to its category. The properties of individual nodes can be displayed as optional captions or a portrait image. Edges are connections between nodes, such as TAKEN_AT or TAKEN_BY. All edges of a given type comprise a Relationship. Each edge is represented by a line connecting two nodes, colored according to its relationship. Directed relationships such as PARENT_OF have an arrow at one end, while directionless ones such as FRIENDS_WITH do not. Properties in a labeled property graph are key-value pairs associated with nodes or edges. Properties include a key such as placeName or country, and a value. Property values can be in the form of numbers, text, geospatial coordinates, date or time. Multiple values can be entered for a property of a node or edge. Data can be added to your graph from many different sources. You can: Pull or query graph data from a Neo4j graph database connected to GraphXR, or load data exported from other graph databases or another GraphXR project. Data exported from a graph environment will include its defined categories, relationships, and properties. Import data in CSV, JSON, and many other formats simply by drag and drop. When you import data that has no associated graph model, such as a flat CSV file, each row in the table is imported as a node of a single default category. In most cases, you will then re-model data imported by drag and drop using GraphXR transforms. Add new nodes and edges of existing or new categories or relationships directly in GraphXR. Normally, you would do this only for very small amounts of data. Edit category, relationship, or property labels, and edit property values. The graph data model is both flexible and extensible. Since data exploration and analysis is highly iterative, this is a powerful advantage. New categories, relationships, and properties can be added, and old ones re-defined as investigation and analysis proceeds. GraphXR’s Mapping Editor lets you construct graph patterns from the columns in a flat CSV file or relational database table, and apply the model during import. Your mapping is saved and can be re-used and edited. It can even be applied to other tabular files that have content labeled in the same way. Once data have been imported, you can Edit category, relationship, or property labels, and edit property values. Use GraphXR Transforms to quickly apply new data models. You can: Extract a property as a new category and define its connected relationship. Aggregate, merge, or simplify complex patterns. Re-format and combine property values as needed.","title":"Graph Data Basics","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"graph-data-basics","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-user/graphxr-start/graph-data-basics.html","titles":[{"text":"The Labeled Property Graph","hash":"_the_labeled_property_graph","id":1},{"text":"Sources of Graph Data","hash":"_sources_of_graph_data","id":2},{"text":"Graph Data Modeling","hash":"_graph_data_modeling","id":3}]},"73":{"id":73,"text":"This section introduces you to: Graph Data Basics.

A context Toolbar, along the bottom of the space, with tools available to use on data currently present or selected. A set of GUI Navigation controls, at the bottom right, for 3D navigation within the project. GraphXR can be used with WebX-connected virtual reality (VR); these controls simulate a VR experience on the desktop. The Main menu on the left edge of the graph space provides access to menu panels and navigation to the home Projects page, logout, or GraphXR information. Mouse over a menu icon to display its label, or click the Main menu icon at the top left to show or hide the menu labels. Most main menu panels are further divided into tabs. Click an icon to display its panel. The Project panel lets you save, update, and access data views, review graph entities, set overall display preferences, import and export data, and access extensions. Tabs in the Project panel include: View tab, to display data views which have been saved to the server, save, update, select, annotate views, and load a data view to the project space. Category and Relationship tabs, to review the defined graph entities, pull specific types of nodes or edges from a connected database and set preferences for display of entities and their properties. Settings tab, to control the size scale, display mode, and captioning of nodes and edges, to set 2D Mode, show or hide the Snapshot dialog, switch to a different Neo4j Database, and modify the project UI Configuration. Data tab, to import data in standard formats such as CSV and GXRF, save data as a CSV or Excel archive, GXRF, or Neo4j database, export all current data views, save an SVG as SVG or PDF, take a PNG screenshot, and create a template from the current project that can be applied to other projects. Extensions tab, to access standard or custom extensions which may be available. The Query panel lets you enter and save Cypher queries on a Neo4j database, and to query SQL databases (MySQL, MSSQL, or PostgreSQL), CSV or JSON files, or use the Gremlin graph traversal language. The SQL and CSV tabs include the Mapping Editor to map data in a flat CSV file or SQL table to a graph model. The Transform panel lets you model and transform graph data directly in GraphXR. This suite of data operators includes: f(x), to execute functions similar to formulas in Excel and SQL or functions in MapReduce frameworks. You can run formulas to add information from one column of data to another, or to modify data formats. Extract, to extract properties from existing nodes to create new nodes and edges and create a new category and relationship. Aggregate, to collect properties from a starting node’s neighboring edges and nodes, apply a calculation, and write the result back to the starting node as a property. Merge, to combine two nodes with matching properties into a single node. Link, to connect nodes with the same property values. This can be used to bring two different data sets together and also to draw explicit connections among nodes of the same type. Shortcut, to connect two nodes that share a common neighbor with a new link. You can use this to simplify the graph. Connector, to provide access to external applications for enhancing or transforming data. The Table panel provides live view of data by Category or Relationship in a searchable tabular format. Enhanced Tables let you rename categories and relationships on the fly, select, sort, edit, reformat, and then export the data in the edited table as a CSV or Excel archive. The Layout panel leets you apply Force, Parametric,Geometric, and Tree layouts to all or part of your data. The Filter panel lets you filter data by Node or Edge properties using multiple composable filters. You can filter on numerical property values including date-time and latitude/longitude, as well as categorical(text string) property values. The Algorithm panel lets you run Path Finding, Centrality, and Community Detection graph algorithms. Results are added to nodes or edges as a property value. The Map panel leets you work with geospatial data on a world map. Nodes with latitude and longitude coordinates are automatically dropped onto the map. At the bottom left the main menu includes items to: Logout. Log out of GraphXR. Home. Return to the Projects home page. Shortcut. Quick reference to keyboard and mouse shortcut keys for navigation and data selection. See also Shortcut Keys Reference. About. Review the GraphXR version and take a Quick Start Tour. The search bar at the top left enables full-text search. You can either: Search the indexed property data in a connected Neo4j database, and import the results to the project, or Search the data already in the graph. Indexed properties are set using the Search Index Configuration dialog. Search results are listed by category below the search bar. Click a single node or a group of nodes in the search results to import the data from the database, or to select nodes returned by a search of data already in the project space. A legend at the top right corner of the project space lets you review and select data by Category, Relationship, Tag, or Property. Select Category, Tag, or Property to display a list of categories, tags, or properties present in the data, and the number of currently selected and total nodes of each. Likewise, select Relationship to display a list of the relationships in the data, and the number of currently selected and total edges for each. When you display categories and relationships at the same time, the relationships are listed below the categories. You can: Monitor how many nodes of each category, tag, property (or edges of each relationship) are currently selected. An addition or subtraction from a selection is immediately updated. Click a list item to select all the nodes for a category, tag, or property, or all the edges for a relationship. Use ctrl-left click to select multiple items. Click the colored line or dot next to a list item to set colors, icons, and more: For a category, you can set Color, an Icon, and select properties to be used for one or more Captions, an Avatar url, and relative node Size. For a relationship, you can set the Color, and select properties for Captions and Bind Width (relative width of the edge). For a listed property value or tag, you can set a Color or an Icon. See Using Display Options. The context toolbar at the bottom edge of the project space displays icons for one-click tools used to navigate, select, and lay out data. Some tools are available only when you select more than one node or edge, or only when you select a single node or a node that has an associated url and weblink property. So as to remain accessible, tool icons are responsively arranged in 2 (or more) rows as you make the browser window narrower. A floating context menu of the tools available for your current selection is available by right-clicking anywhere in the project space. It is an easier way to navigate and edit the graph without using the toolbar or opening additional panels. In addition, the menu can be customized as needed. The default right-click menu includes the following often-used tools at the top level: Information, Add Node, Add Edge, Expand,Find Path, Center To, Fly Out, and Delete. Select, Actions, and Layout submenus organize tools further as follows: Select submenu: All Nodes, Add to Selection, Subtract from Selection, Invert, Deselect, Floating Nodes, Leaf Nodes, Neighbor Nodes, Neighbor Edges, Child Nodes, Parent Nodes, and Connected Nodes. Actions submenu: Change Category, Collect Nodes, Explode Nodes, Tag, Hide, Show Hidden, Pin, and Release. Layout submenu: Line, Grid, Cube, Circle, Sphere, Spiral, Tree, Ring, Expand, and Contract. Layouts are grayed out if unavailable for the selected data. By default, Quick Information, Disable/Enable Force Layout, Clear All, Screenshot, Link, and Image tools appear only in the toolbar. Most, but not all, of the functions provided in the right-click menu are available in the toolbar or one of the main menu panels. The following table lists those available only in the right-click menu. Right-Click Menu Only Function Find Path Similar to the function in the Algorithm>Path Finding tab. It finds a path between just two selected nodes. Select > Add to Selection Mouse over an unselected node, right click and use this menu item to add the node to already selected nodes. Select > Subtract from Selection Mouse over a selected node, right click and use this menu item to de-select the node. Select > Floating Nodes Nodes with no connecting edges. Select > Leaf Nodes Nodes with only one connecting edge. Select > Neighbor Nodes Nodes one hop away from selected nodes. Choose again to select nodes another hop away. This is similar to the Trace Neighbor tool, except that one hop at a time is found and the nodes are selected, not just highlighted. Select > Child Nodes_ Nodes one forward hop away from selected nodes (as shown by the direction of the connected edge). Choose again to select nodes another hop away. Select > Parent Nodes Nodes one reverse hop away from selected nodes (as shown by the direction of the connected edge). Choose again to select nodes another hop away. Select > Neighbor Edges Nodes one edge away from selected nodes. Select > Connected Nodes Nodes connected to selected edges. Actions > Change Category Displays a dialog that lets you immediately change the category of any selection of nodes to any other existing category or to a new category. Properties of the changed nodes not present in the target category are transferred. Actions>Change Category cannot be undone with Ctrl+Z. Before using it, save a data View, snapshot, or .GXRF file so that you can undo a mistaken change. The toolbar icons at the bottom edge of the project space appear depending on the data that’s currently present and/or selected. Toolbar icons in a project with no data present are: Add Node. Displays a dialog to define and add a single node. Quick Info. Toggles between turning on and off Quick Info rollovers for nodes and edges. Disable/Enable Force Layout. Toggles between turning on and off a force directed physics layout. Once you load or create at least one node, more toolbar icons appear. Select Visible Nodes. Selects all nodes currently visible in the graph space (those not hidden using Hide Selection or by de-selecting the Visible checkbox for a category or relationship in the Project panel). Take Screenshot. Takes a .png screenshot of the graph space including the legend, but excluding an open panel, toolbar and GUI navigation controls. Center To.

The badge at the upper right of the icon shows the number of currently selected nodes. Un-Hide Selection. Appears after you select and hide nodes. Click to restore all hidden nodes and edges to the graph space and de-select them. Hide Selection. Hides selected nodes and edges temporarily. When you select a single node, two additional tool icons appear: Image and WebLink. These two icons appear if an image and/or url is attached to a node. Select a node and click Image to display a small image in the graph space close to its node, and click again to hide the image. Click WebLink to open a browser window to a linked image or webpage. Information. Opens a floating information pane for a selected single node or edge. Its Properties tab lists the properties of the node or edge. If desired, you can add properties and edit property values in this window. Its Neighbors tab displays a count of nodes connected to the selected node through one edge, and a live graphic of the nodes and edges. The GUI navigation panel at the bottom right of the graph space provides simulated Virtual Reality (VR) navigation controls for use on the desktop. Click and hold the upper arrows to Move Right, Move Left, Move Up, or Move Down. Click the central circle to Reset the view to the center point of the data (similar to the Center To toolbar icon).

Use the language selector to switch between the default English or Chinese UI (or other localized languages which may be provided). The body of the Projects page lets you create and manage your GraphXR projects: Use the Search bar at the top of the page to find one or more projects by name. Click the display icon to show projects in a more compact list, instead of the default tiles. Projects are organized into the following sections: Recent Projects displays projects you have recently opened. My Projects lets you Create a new project, and shows projects you’ve created. Demo Projects provides a Select Demo dropdown to select a demo project from those available. Shared Projects shows projects that other users have created and shared with you. To get started quickly with GraphXR you can explore a Demo project. Demo projects are limited to three projects which can have up to 500 nodes and edges and three views. You cannot share a demo project or export data views. To open a Demo project: Click a demo project tile, for example, the VC demo, to enter its project space. This demo includes venture capital investor data. It is connected to a Neo4j database. The project’s graph space is empty when you open it. You’ll either pull data from the connected database or load a saved data view. Click the Project menu item on the upper left side of the browser window. The Project panel opens, with the Views tab open. It includes thumbnail images for data views which have been saved (if any). A view menu at the top center of the project space indicates the view that’s currently loaded. The current view is listed as an Unsaved View in the VC project. Now click the Category tab and Relationship tab to explore categories and relationships that are in the Neo4j database connected to the project. The VC demo uses a very simple schema such that nodes of just one Investor category are connected through edges of a single link_to relationship. A color has been assigned to the category and the relationship, and each includes a list of defined properties. Click the Pull button on the Investor category to quickly import 25 nodes of that category from the database. This is a quick way to import some data. You can also import more data from Neo4j. You can: Search the database. For example, in the search bar at the top left, we can search for any Investor with the name \"Partner\", then import some or all of the nodes found in the database into the graph. + Expand on relationships using GraphXR’s Expand function. It brings in additional nodes connected through relationships you select. To try this, click on one or more Investor nodes, then right click and choose Expand from the menu. In the Expand with Relationships dialog, click the Expand button. Additional nodes which are connected to the selected Investor node have been returned. Query the database directly. Since the VC demo is connected to a Neo4j database, you can go to the Query panel and Cypher tab and run a simple example Cypher query. Click the Collection List arrow to display the sample query, and click on it to copy it to the Cypher query window. To bring in a sample of ten more nodes and their relationships, we can edit the LIMIT parameter to return ten nodes instead of 100. Then click the Run arrow. Now you can save the data view on the server so that when you return to this project, either after going back to the Projects page or logging out, your view will still be available. From the view menu, select Save As, enter a descriptive view name, and click Submit. Open the Project panel and View tab to see that the thumbnail of your saved view has been added. If you want to save a view, you must do it before exiting the project. You can create and configure a new GraphXR project and either leave the project unconnected, or immediately connect to a Neo4j database. In a standalone project (one that’s not connected to a Neo4j database) you can import and work with data in formats such as CSV, SQL, JSON, GraphXR’s GXRF and Snapshot files, and others. You can import a data file into the project simply by drag and drop, or use GraphXR’s Mapping Editor. To create a standalone project: In the Projects page, click the Create button or tile in the My Projects area. In the Project Name text box, enter a descriptive project name. Leave Config Neo4j Instance unchecked. If project templates have been provided, you can optionally select one from the dropdown menu. Templates specify colors, icons and other settings so that they can be easily applied to more than one project. Click Confirm. The new project is automatically opened. To see that it now appears under My Projects, click the Home button to exit the project and return to the Projects page. A new project is configured according to the template used (if any) and a variety of default settings. You can configure project details at any time: Click the project’s Enable Share/Disable Share (Lock) icon to enable sharing of data views with another user. Share users you Invite have access only to that project and the data views that you share. Use ShareUI Config to restrict share users' ability to navigate or edit project data. Click the Edit icon to edit project configuration. Click the Clone icon to duplicate the project. Click the Delete (trash can) icon to delete the project. Connect a new or existing project to an existing Neo4j graph database by specifying the database and server details. To create a project connected to a Neo4j database: In the Projects page, under My Projects click the Create button. Now click the Configure Neo4j Instance checkbox. Enter the information required to connect to your Neo4j database: Project Name: Descriptive name, (e.g., the name of the Neo4j database).

There is no intrinsic meaning to node position or edge length in a force-directed layout. Rather, the rendering is designed to result in a graph that is visually pleasing and reasonably easy to navigate. GraphXR provides a default force-directed layout, but you can: Adjust force layout parameters for the entire graph, and restore default settings. Randomize node positions for all or part of the graph. Temporarily disable force layout for all or part the graph. Run a brief force layout simulation for the entire graph. The Force tab of the Layout panel includes a set of sliders to adjust default layout parameters for the entire graph. You can adjust parameters as follows: Link Strength. Adjusts how strongly the links (i.e. edges) pull the nodes together. Link Distance. Adjusts the distance between nodes (i.e. edge length). Gravity. Pulls the nodes toward the center of the graph space, that is, the point the view rotates around when nothing is selected. Charge. Adjusts how strongly the nodes push away from one another. Collision. Adjusts the degree to which nodes are allowed to overlap each other. This is especially useful in a 2D layout, to un-stack nodes projected on top of one another. When set all the way to the right, some overlap can still occur. Z Compress. Compresses nodes on the Z axis to become a flatter, more 2D layout. To project a 3D view to near-2D, set the Z-Compress slider all the way to the rightmost position. You will still be able to rotate the data in 3D. Click the Restore Default Settings button to restore the sliders to their default positions and re-render the default force layout for the selected graph. Any pinned node is excluded from adjustment, and left where it was placed. This applies to nodes you’ve arranged manually in the project space, and to those pinned automatically using a geometric layout. To release pinned nodes, either use the Pin/Release toolbar icon or right-click menu, or the Release button in the Geometric layout panel. 3D visualization provides a powerful advantage for exploring high-dimensional data. However, you can switch to 2D mode at any time, or even work exclusively in 2D mode. For example, a flat 2D project space can be useful when creating and sharing views for analytic reports of various kinds. Many of the Geometric layouts do translate well to purely 2D presentation, including Line, Circle, Spiral, and Grid, as well as hierarchical Rings or Trees To set the project space to 2D: In the Project panel and Settings tab, click the 2D Mode checkbox. Project data are now arranged on a flat plane, and the data cannot be rotated in 3D. In the Force layout tab the Z-Compress slider is no longer displayed. The 3D Cube, Spring, and Sphere geometric layouts are no longer available. In Force layout, nodes are rendered in randomized positions. The Randomize Node Positions button lets you render a different random arrangement either for selected data, or all data if no data are selected (except for any pinned nodes). To randomize a force-directed layout: Select nodes using any method. If no nodes are selected, all node positions are randomized, except for any pinned nodes. Make sure that the label next to the icon reads Disable Force Layout. This means that force layout is currently enabled, and your selection will be randomized according to the current force layout parameters. Click the Randomize Node Positions button to render a different random force layout for your selection. You can disable the force layout for all or part of the graph. This causes selected nodes to be rendered in a random, more compact arrangement that does not use a force-directed simulation. This can help you focus quickly on subgraphs of interest. To disable force layout and randomize node positions: Select nodes using any method. Click the force layout icon. The text next to the icon should now read Enable Force Layout, which means that force layout is currently disabled. Click the Randomize Node Positions button to display a different random order for your selection. The selected data are randomized in a more compact layout, while the data not selected remains in force layout. If no data are selected, all node positions are randomized in a non-force layout, except for any pinned nodes. Click the icon next to Enable Force Layout at any time to return the selected nodes to force-directed layout. With force layout enabled, you can click Run to run a brief (1- or 2- second) force layout simulation for the entire graph. Click Stop to freeze the layout when you see a rendering you like.","title":"Using Force Layouts","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"force-layout","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-user/layouts/force-layout.html","titles":[{"text":"Adjusting Force layout parameters","hash":"_adjusting_force_layout_parameters","id":1},{"text":"Restricting layouts to 2D","hash":"_restricting_layouts_to_2d","id":2},{"text":"Randomizing node positions","hash":"_randomizing_node_positions","id":3},{"text":"Disabling Force Layout","hash":"_disabling_force_layout","id":4},{"text":"Using Run and Stop","hash":"_using_run_and_stop","id":5}]},"78":{"id":78,"text":"Geometric layouts let you arrange all nodes or selected nodes in a Line, Grid, Cube, Circle, Sphere, Spiral, or Spring ordered by one of the property values in the data. The edges between nodes continue to be displayed. In addition, you can: Distribute selected nodes in an X, Y, or Z direction ordered by a property value. This is useful for grouping data by date and time or other numerical or categorical property values. Align nodes along the virtual X, Y, and Z axes of the project space. Rotate, Scale, and Shift nodes in the project space by specified amounts. This provides fine control of layouts to craft compelling visualizations. Apply Ring or Tree layouts around selected central nodes, and specify the depth of the hierarchy and the relative length of the edges. You can combine layouts in a variety of ways. The layout shown above uses a Grid layout for one of the categories of nodes (Location), and then applies a Ring layout to the nodes of a different category (Photos) which are connected by one edge to the nodes in the grid. Layouts can’t be reverted easily, so make a habit of saving Snapshots or data Views as you work. To share a static image of a layout, you can click the Take Screenshot icon in the toolbar. It downloads a .png screenshot of the project space that includes just the data and the legend (not the toolbar, panel menu, panel or any other UI elements). You can apply one of the named geometric layouts, either to all the data or to any selection. In the example layout above, nodes for each category are displayed in a different geometry. To apply a geometric layout: Open the Layout panel and Geometric tab. Select nodes to lay out using any method. Often, you’ll want to use the lists in the legend to select all the nodes of a given category or tag. If no nodes are selected, the layout is applied to all the data. Now click the Line, Grid, Cube, Circle, Sphere, Spiral, or Spring button to display the data in that layout. The nodes are still selected after you apply the layout. You can move them as group and further adjust the orientation, size, and position using Rotate, Scale, and Shift layout controls. + WARNING: Be aware that the Release button on the Layout panel will release any pinned nodes and return the entire graph to a force layout, regardless of whether any nodes are selected. This action cannot be undone. To avoid losing useful layouts by mistake, save data Views or take Snapshots regularly as you work. One of the property values in the data you select can be used to order the nodes in a geometric layout. To order a geometric layout by a property value: Select nodes to be ordered. For example, use the legend to select all nodes of a given category. In the Layout section, click the Order by property checkbox to display its Category and Property dropdown menus. Select the category and property name you want. Click the Ascend or Descend checkbox to display the nodes in either ascending or descending order. Click a geometric layout button to apply it (i.e. Line, Grid, Cube, Circle, Sphere, Spiral, or Spring.) Distribution uses one of the property values available in a selection of data to group the nodes and distribute the groups in the project space along the X, Y, or Z direction. With Distribution, you can group data quickly by any date, numerical or categorical property available in your data. This helps highlight patterns quickly and makes it easier to select groups of nodes for further inspection, labeling, and analysis. To distribute nodes by a property value: Select nodes to to be grouped and distributed, for example, using the legend to select all nodes of a given category. Click the Spread Out checkbox to enter a scale Range by which the groups of nodes will be distributed in the graph space. Click the Distribution option’s Order by Property checkbox to display Category and Property dropdown menus. Select the category and property you want. Click the Ascend or Descend checkbox to display the distributed groups in either ascending or descending order. Click either Number, Date, or Categorical checkboxes, depending on the value of the property you selected. Now click the X, Y, or Z button to group and distribute the selected data. In the example, we’ve chosen to group Photos nodes by their Ratings property values (1 to 5), and to distribute the groups on the X axis. You can further adjust distributed groups using Rotate, Scale, and Shift layout controls. Nodes that are grouped and distributed are pinned in the graph space. So if the distribution isn’t quite what you want, simply press the Release toolbar icon (or Ctrl+P) to start over. The Align option projects the selected (or all) nodes onto the remaining axes. For example, click X to project nodes to the Y and Z axes. If you click two of the buttons, for example, X and Z, the nodes are projected onto the Y axis, in a line. Align is useful for organizing and separating data into specific groupings. In the example below, Location nodes, and distributed Photo nodes grouped by Rating are all projected onto an X axis (and the Location nodes moved up using left-click-drag). If you click all three buttons, the nodes are stacked on top of one another at the origin viewpoint. While they are still selected, you can click one of the Layout options to unstack them. You can also click the Release button in the Layout section to return them to a force layout. You can move the nodes in a layout as a group, and you can further adjust the orientation, size, and position using Rotate, Scale, and Shift layout controls. You can select any group of nodes. If no data are selected, the controls operate on all the data. You can: Rotate separately along the X, Y, or Z axes, for fine-tuned control of 3D orientation. Enter a number of degrees to rotate the layout (either a positive or negative value), then click Rotate X, Rotate Y, or Rotate Z buttons. Scale a selection (or the entire layout). You can either expand or contract the scale, and choose to scale along X, Y, and/or Z axes as well. Enter a Scale factor, select axes using the checkboxes, then click Expand or Contract. For example, you can expand the scale for data displayed in a line, and contract the scale for other data displayed in circles or grids. Shift data on the X, Y, or Z axis to separate selected data visually in the graph space. Enter a Shift factor (either a positive or negative value) and click X, Y, or Z. With Ring or Tree hierarchical layouts, you select a node (or nodes) as central points, and neighboring nodes are automatically arranged according to the number of edges away they are from the centers. Ring or tree hierarchies can greatly aid visualization when combined with another geometric layout, such as the following Grid layout: They are also useful for geospatial display since the rings or trees persist when central data nodes with lat-long coordinates are dropped onto the map. You can: Set the Ego Depth of the hierarchy (i.e. the number hops from the selected central nodes to include). The default depth of 100 will typically include all the data since a depth of 100 connections will cover most graphs. For example, with an Ego depth of 3, nodes NOT selected as centers AND three edges away are included. Nodes further away remain in the original force layout. Set the relative Length of the connecting edges. The default length of 0.4 is suitable for many graphs. Order the data in rings or trees by a property value. Orient rings or trees using Left, Right, Up or Down checkboxes. To display a hierarchical ring layout: Select nodes of primary interest as your center nodes. In this example from a contact tracing dataset, we select all Infected_Person nodes, laid out in a grid ordered by the number of connections for each node. Now scroll down to the Scale option and click the Expand button several times to expand the grid layout. This makes room to arrange first- and second- level contacts in rings around the central nodes. With the central Infected_Person nodes still selected, click the Ring button. With the default Ego depth of 100, nodes NOT selected as centers AND 100 edges away are displayed in concentric rings around the central nodes. You can adjust the display further using Left, Right, Up, or Down checkboxes. Click one of the checkboxes, then click Rings to rotate or reflect the connected rings. To display a hierarchical tree layout: Select nodes of primary interest as your central nodes. In this example from a contact tracing dataset, we select all Infected_Person nodes, laid out in a grid ordered by the number of connections for each node. Scroll down to the Scale option and click the Expand button several times to expand the grid. This makes room to arrange first- and second- level contacts in trees connected to the central nodes. With Infected_Person nodes still selected, click Trees to see a tree layout for nodes the default 100 edges away from the selected nodes. You can adjust the layout further using Left, Right, Up, or Down checkboxes. Click one of the checkboxes (for example, Right), then with your central nodes selected, click Trees to see the layout to the left of the central nodes. Now click the Up checkbox and click Trees again. The tree layouts now appear above the central nodes, rather than to the left of them. The Quick Layout toolbar icon displays a menu that lets you quickly apply and modify pre-set geometric layouts to all or part of your data. This menu is also provided on the right-click context menu under Layout. You can select items on the menu to: Apply a Line, Grid, Cube, Circle, Spiral, or Spring layout to any selection of nodes. Apply a Ring or Tree hierarchical layout. You can select central nodes first, but it is not required. If you apply the layout to all the data, GraphXR will determine the nodes most likely to be central. For simpler graph patterns, selecting central nodes first may not make a difference. Expand or Contract the layout of any selection of nodes. With Quick Layout you cannot order nodes by property value, distribute nodes, specify controlled Shift or Rotate actions, or enter specifications for a Ring or Tree layout. You can, however, reposition selected nodes using navigation controls (e.g left-click drag to shift or right-click drag to rotate.) To create a Quick Layout: Select nodes using any selection method and click the Quick Layout toolbar icon to display the quick layout menu. Select one of the quick layout options (for example Line). With the nodes still selected, you can click Expand or Contract on the menu to adjust the size of the layout. If you need to make room for hierarchical rings or trees in an initial geometric layout, expand the layout first, then apply the additional hierarchical layout. With the nodes still selected, choose Ring or Tree. Selecting Expand or Contract in the above ring layout expands only the layout of the selected central nodes, not the rings.","title":"Using Geometric Layouts","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"geometric-layouts","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-user/layouts/geometric-layouts.html","titles":[{"text":"Applying a geometric layout","hash":"_applying_a_geometric_layout","id":1},{"text":"Ordering nodes in a geometric layout by a property value","hash":"_ordering_nodes_in_a_geometric_layout_by_a_property_value","id":2},{"text":"Distributing nodes by a property value","hash":"_distributing_nodes_by_a_property_value","id":3},{"text":"Aligning nodes","hash":"_aligning_nodes","id":4},{"text":"Using the Rotate, Scale, and Shift layout controls","hash":"_using_the_rotate_scale_and_shift_layout_controls","id":5},{"text":"Using Ring or Tree hierarchical layouts","hash":"_using_ring_or_tree_hierarchical_layouts","id":6},{"text":"Using Quick Layouts","hash":"_using_quick_layouts","id":7}]},"79":{"id":79,"text":"A Parametric layout enables you to create scatter plots by displaying any numerical property value encoded in your data on X-, Y-, or Z- axes.

By enabling you to select, organize and separate data in the graph space, layouts make it possible to create and share information-rich visualizations of high-dimensional data. Options include sorting by property value, positioning and setting orientation along X- Y- and Z- axes, and much more. Layouts (and the geospatial mapping provided in the Map panel) rely on the ability to fix, or Pin nodes in 3D space in various specific ways, and to Release the pinned nodes when desired. Tabs in the Layout panel let you arrange data in the project space in a variety of Force directed, Parametric, Geometric, or hierarchical Tree layouts. The default force-directed layout renders nodes and edges in the graph space using a physics simulation that attempts to keep individual nodes and edges close enough, while reducing the number of crossing lines or hidden entities. You can adjust simulation parameters including link strength and distance, gravity, collision, and more. Create scatter plots of nodes based on property values which are saved along with a saved view. Arrange any selected group of nodes in a Line, Grid, Circle, Spiral, Cube, or Spring layout. The nodes involved can be ordered by property value and the layout can be scaled, placed, and rotated along X-, Y-, or Z- axes in the project space. You can also apply Ring or Tree layouts around selected central nodes, and specify the depth of the hierarchy and the relative edge length. One-click geometric layouts are available through the Quick Layout menu in the toolbar and the right-click context menu. You can apply geometric layouts (Line, Grid, Circle, Spiral, Cube, Spring, Ego Tree, or Ring) to any selection of nodes in one click, and to Expand or Contract the layout in pre-set increments. These easy layouts provide rapid visualization, and are especially useful when you don’t immediately need to order or distribute nodes by property value, or fine-tune the 3D orientation of your layout. This layout automatically arranges nodes in a hierarchical tree structure that you can modify on the fly. Pinning locks a nodes to its current position in the 3D project space. GraphXR automatically pins nodes when you: Move one or more selected nodes to a new position. Apply a Geometric layout. The nodes become pinned to their new layout position.

Collected nodes are gathered into special collection nodes indicated by four circles displayed inside a node. A collection node is automatically given a temporary category label of the form Collection Category label. This label immediately appears in the Category legend when you collect nodes. In the legend, the number of collection nodes of each type is listed, along with the number currently selected. The following properties are created: collection. A boolean set to true. count.

The category label of the nodes in the collection (e.g. Crimes). The edges of the nodes in the collection (if any) are temporarily collapsed into a single collection edge. The relationship name remains the same, but the direction is reversed. The count of edges in the legend does not distinguish between an edge that connects to a collection and one that connects to a single node. However, in a Table of the edges of that relationship, a collection’s Source identifier is the label property value for the collection node, rather than an identifier of a single edge. The information window for a collection node shows the category and number of nodes in the collection, and displays a list of the collected nodes. Properties set as captions in the original collected category appear as headings in the information window. You can edit these at any time. In the Projects>Category tab, click the category, then select the Caption checkbox for each property in the order you want them to appear. To remove a node from the collection, click its minus icon. A collection is created from nodes which are all connected by the same relationship. If a node has connected edges of more than one relationship it can still be included in a collection. For an example, we’ll collect Photo nodes connected to Location nodes through TAKEN_AT edges. The graph also includes Author nodes connected to the Photo nodes through different TAKEN_BY edges, as well as a few floating nodes (with no connections). To create collections: Select Photo nodes using the Category list in the legend. You can select specific nodes using any method. For example, to collect only the Photo nodes connected to specific Locations, select the Location nodes, right-click and choose Select > Neighbor Nodes. Also note that if nothing is selected, any valid collections in the entire graph are created automatically. Click Collect Nodes on the toolbar, or right-click and choose Actions > Collect Nodes. Nodes of a single category connected by zero or one edge to another node are collected into separate collection nodes and disappear from the graph.

Set a range by entering minimum and maximum values in the Min and Max text boxes (e.g. 5 and 10). The project space now includes only the filtered data. List items in the legend are updated to show the filtered numbers for each category, relationship, etc. The animation playhead lets you play through the range of filtered values. You can set start and ending values on the slider, then enter a duration and select options for the direction of play and for continuous looping through the filter values. Each filter has its own independently set playhead. You can dismiss the Filter panel and continue working with the filtered data. The data that’s filtered out is only hidden, not deleted. To restore the hidden data, delete the operative filter. This example uses a dataset of crimes and their investigating officers. We can filter the data by type of crime, which is a text string property. To filter using categorical properties: Open the Filter panel. From the Node Properties menu, choose the property (e.g. type). The filter is labeled with the property name and the category or relationship label ( type(Crime)). The property values in the data are displayed in alphanumeric order, with a Show checkbox for each. All values are selected by default. Click the Select All checkbox to deselect everything, and then choose the values you want. In the example, we’ve chosen various types of theft (e.g. bicycle theft, burglary, shoplifting, etc.) The data in the project space now includes only the filtered data. List items in the legend are updated to show the new numbers for each category, relationship, etc. To restore data hidden by a filter, delete that filter. To see all your data again, clear (i.e., delete) all your existing filters. Click the Delete button above the filter’s slider, or click the property name in the Node Properties menu. Filters do not persist when you exit the project. However, when you load a saved View or Snapshot of a filtered graph, the filters are restored and the data that was filtered out is hidden. Filters do not delete data; if you want to delete filtered data, it must be explicitly selected and deleted. You can delete either the visible data, or the data that has been filtered out. To delete visible data: Click Select Visible Nodes and press del or backspace. The visible nodes and any connected edges are deleted. The graph space appears empty. Clear your filters to restore data that was filtered out. Click the Del button to the right of the filter’s slider (or the x next to the property name in the Node Properties menu). To delete filtered data: Click Select Visible Nodes (the nodes you want to keep). Clear your filters to restore data that was filtered out. Click the Del button to the right of the filter’s slider (or the x next to the property name in the Node Properties menu). All the data appears, with the nodes and connecting edges you want still selected. Click Inverse to invert the selection. Press del or backspace to delete. You can click Hide Selection in the toolbar or right-click Actions menu to hide data temporarily, rather than delete it. Starting with filtered results, the right-click select and add mode that operates on the Select menu lets you build subgraphs quickly. To add to a selection simply hold down Ctrl or Alt before choosing an item on the Select menu. Available options include Floating Nodes, Leaf Nodes, Neighbor Nodes, Child Nodes, Parent Nodes, Neighbor Edges, and Connected Nodes. In the categorical filter example above, Crimes involving theft of various kinds have been retained. We can now isolate the graph of Officers who investigated those filtered Crimes. To isolate a subgraph from filtered data: With the filter applied, in the Legend, click to select e.g. the Crime nodes. Right-click, press Ctrl and choose Select > Neighbor Edges to add the edges to the current selection. Right-click again, press Ctrl and choose Select > Connected Nodes to add the connected Officer nodes to the current selection. A subgraph of filtered Crime nodes, the investigating Officer nodes, and the INVESTIGATED_BY edges are selected. left click + drag to move the selected subgraph away from the rest of the visible data. You can now clear the filter to show all the data, then use Inverse to select data not on the subgraph and Actions > Hide to hide that data (or Delete to delete it). Save the subgraph by taking a snapshot or saving it as a new View.","title":"Filtering Data","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"filter","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-user/nav-select/filter.html","titles":[{"text":"Filtering on numerical properties","hash":"_filtering_on_numerical_properties","id":1},{"text":"Filtering on categorical properties","hash":"_filtering_on_categorical_properties","id":2},{"text":"Clearing a filter","hash":"_clearing_a_filter","id":3},{"text":"Saving or deleting filtered nodes with Select Visible Nodes","hash":"_saving_or_deleting_filtered_nodes_with_select_visible_nodes","id":4},{"text":"Isolating subgraphs from filtered data","hash":"_isolating_subgraphs_from_filtered_data","id":5}]},"85":{"id":85,"text":"Hiding nodes temporarily can be useful for focusing on subsets of graph data that you may want to work with further, or clear from the graph.

A message displays indicating success, and the _graphxrtags property is added to the selected tagged nodes, with the tag name as its property value. In the Property legend, you can view the list _graphxrtags property values. For nodes with more than one tag, the value is the different tag names separated by colons. Click the X at the upper right to dismiss the Manager Tags dialog. To inspect the _graphxrtags property and its values, either: Display a single node’s information window (Ctrl+I) or quick info rollover. Open a Table for a group of selected nodes. To add or remove a tag: Select a group of nodes using any selection method. Click the Tag icon or select Actions>Tag in the right-click menu to display the Manager Tags dialog. Locate a tag name and either: Click the + icon on the tag label to add the tag to the selected nodes. OR Click the - icon on the tag label to remove the tag from the selected nodes. The number of tagged nodes for that tag is immediately updated. If the tag has been removed from all nodes, the tag name disappears from the dialog. Click the X at the top right to dismiss the Manager Tags dialog. You can remove all the tags from any selection of nodes in one step, rather than selecting nodes with specific tags and then deleting that tag individually. To clean tags from selected nodes: Select a group of nodes using any selection method. Click the Tag icon or Actions>Tag in the right-click menu to display the Manager Tags dialog. Click Clean Nodes Tags. All of the tags applied to those nodes are removed. In the Manager Tags dialog and in the Tag legend, the total number of nodes for each tag is updated. If no nodes remain, the tag is deleted. In the graph, the tag label is removed from the selected nodes, and when viewed using the Tag legend, the tag color and icon (if any) is removed.","title":"Tagging Selected Nodes","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"tag-nodes","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-user/nav-select/tag-nodes.html","titles":[{"text":"Creating a new tag","hash":"_creating_a_new_tag","id":1},{"text":"Saving tags as a temporary property","hash":"_saving_tags_as_a_temporary_property","id":2},{"text":"Adding or removing a tag","hash":"_adding_or_removing_a_tag","id":3},{"text":"Cleaning all tags from selected nodes","hash":"_cleaning_all_tags_from_selected_nodes","id":4}]},"91":{"id":91,"text":"The Transform panel provides a suite of graph-based data operators to transform data.

The ability to view the results immediately in GraphXR makes modeling data on the fly both more visual and more intuitive. Graph-based operators in the Transform panel are: f(x) (i.e. function), to calculate values based on one or more existing properties and write the results back to the source nodes or edges. Extract, to extract nodes and edges belonging to new or existing categories and relationships, based on one or more source properties. Aggregate, to gather properties from a node’s neighboring nodes or edges, optionally perform a function on those values, and write the result back to the origin node. Merge, to merge nodes sharing matched properties into a single node. Link, to connect nodes that share matched property values. Shortcut, to create a new relationship between nodes that share a common neighbor. Connector, to access APIs for third party applications that can inject additional data or transform existing data.

You can use Aggregate to generate quantitative data relating to how graph data are connected. For example, in a telephone call log, you can aggregate the number of incoming and outgoing calls for a given caller, and write that aggregate value as a property on each caller node. The Aggregate transform starts from a node, collects neighbors connected by a specified relationship, calculates new aggregate property values, and writes them back to the original node as a new property. You can aggregate along either a property of neighbor nodes or a property of connecting edges. Preset formulas are available for often-used calculations, as shown in the following table. You can also enter a custom javascript formula. Preset Function Format custom Editable format take first Copies the first value of another property. (neighborPropValues) => _.size(neighborPropValues) > 0 ? neighborPropValues[0] : null count Calculates a value based on number of connections.

We can use Aggregate to find the total number of lines spoken on each Game of Thrones episode. Examples use the open-source dataset for the HBO Game of Thrones series. For a hands-on exercise see our How to GraphXR tutorials. A Lines.csv file includes data about the dialog in the show, and an Episodes.csv file includes details about each season and episode. We first transform data imported from these files as follows: Use the f(x) transform to calculate seasonEpisode property values for the Episodes category. This allows us to match the seasonEpisode property in the Lines category. Use the Link transform to link lines to their respective episodes through a new SPOKEN_ON relationship. To aggregate connections between nodes: Select one or more nodes. For example, click the Episodes category to select its nodes. Open the Transform panel and Aggregate tab, and enter the following: In Aggregate To Category, select Episodes. In Aggregate Along select the SPOKEN_ON relationship. Click Property from neighbor nodes and select the lineCount property. In the New Prop textbox, enter totalLines. This is the new aggregate property that will contain the total number of lines of dialog in an episode. In the Formula Name menu, select the sum preset. A sample result is displayed below the property name. Click Run. Error and completion messages appear below the Run button. Since we are just adding a new property, the graph does not visually change. To review the new totalLines property, open the Table panel, click the Category tab, and select Episodes.

To illustrate, we’ll extract new categories from a CSV file that’s imported by drag and drop. The Characters.csv file shown below tabulates information about each character in HBO’s Game of Thrones series. All the data is imported as a single default Characters category. Now we want to extract a separate House category for the family each character belongs to. We can extract a houseName property from Character nodes, and use it to create both a House category and a new BELONGS_TO relationship that connects House nodes to the original Characters nodes. Examples use the open-source dataset for the HBO Game of Thrones series. For a hands-on exercise see our How to GraphXR tutorials. To extract a new category and connecting relationships: In the project space, de-select the data to extract from the entire data set. If you select nodes, Extract operates on only those elements. With nothing selected, transformations affect the whole graph. Open the Transform panel and Extract tab, and enter the following details: In the Extract From Category menu, select Characters, which will appear as the Source Category. If there is only one category in the graph, it is already entered as the Source Category, and the menu does not appear. In the New Relationship textbox, enter BELONGS_TO. In the New Category textbox, enter House. In the Create Category From Property area, select the houseName property from the menu (or click the + (plus) icon next to its name in the table below) to add it to the Selected Property list. Properties in the source data are listed alphabetically in the scrollable list of properties. A sample of data displays below the property names, showing property values and data formats. The selected property name appears in the New Property Name text box. You can enter a different property name, but we’ll leave it unchanged for this example. Click the Key checkbox to set houseName as a key, so that a single node will be created for each unique value of houseName, rather than a separate one for every source node. If the property value is a list and not a single value, you can click the Split checkbox to create a separate node for each value in the list. Otherwise, a single node will be created with only the first value in the list. Optionally, you can specify additional extraction behavior: Click SkipEmpty to extract the specified pattern only when the source property is present and its value is non-null. For example, the (Character)-[BELONGS_TO]-(House) pattern would be created only for Character nodes that include a houseName property and value. Click Inherit Links to copy any edges connected to the original category to the new extracted category. Our graph does not yet include any edges so we’ll leave it unchecked. Scroll down to the bottom of the panel and click Run. Errors and a completion messages appear below the Run button. The legend now displays the new House category and the new BELONGS_TO relationship. Extracted House nodes appear in the graph space, connected to their respective Character nodes by new BELONGS_TO edges. Since Skip Empty was left unchecked, source nodes with no houseName value are assigned to an unlabeled House node, connected to their respective Character nodes through BELONGS_TO edges. In the Property list, the houseName property of the unlabeled House node appears as \"`not available`\".","title":"Using Extract","component":"user-guides","version":"2.17","name":"tr-extract","url":"/user-guides/2.17/g-user/transform-data/tr-extract.html","titles":[]},"95":{"id":95,"text":"With graph-based f(x) functions you can calculate values based on existing properties and write the results back to the source nodes or edges. This capability is similar to formulas in Excel and SQL, and functions in a MapReduce framework. An f(x) formula lets you run javascript formulas on a single category or relationship. You select existing properties in the data to create new properties according to pre-defined or custom formulas. The following table lists the available preset formulas and their general formats. Preset Function Format toCustom Editable format (propVal,props) => propVal toNumber String or Number => a Number (propVal,props) => Number(propVal) | 0 toString String, Number, or Date => a String (propVal,props) => String(propVal) toDate Valid date-time => a YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss timestamp (propVal,props) => moment(propVal).format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss') toWeek Valid date-time => a weekday (e.g. Monday) (propVal,props) => moment(propVal).format('dddd') convertCustomDate Custom date format MM,DD,YYYY => a YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss timestamp (propVal,props) => moment(propVal, \"MM,DD,YYYY\").format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss') fullName Combine firstName and lastName property values => the new property, as a full name. (propVal,props) => !props['firstName'] ? propVal : ${props['firstName']}-${props['lastName']} Editing a preset moves it to the toCustom item, where you can test or run the edited formula. Formulas apply to a single category or relationship at a time. However, you can run more than one formula at a time on a selection of data. In the following example numerical data in the file ImportSample.csv has been entered as a text string. We’ll use the toNumber preset to transform the data to numerical values. To run preset formulas to create and populate new properties: Deselect all the data in the graph space to ensure that the transform applies to all nodes or edges of a specified Category or Relationship. Open the Transform panel and f(x) tab. Select a Category or Relationship for the data you want to operate on (e.g. ImportSample). In the Apply Formula to Properties dropdown, select the property value to transform (e.g. Score), or click the + icon in the table of properties below the dropdown to select it. The review panel below the properties shows a sample of existing values and their data formats. Choose a preset formula from the dropdown menu, in this case, *toNumber*, to convert the Score text string to a numerical value. Enter a new property name (e.g. scoreNumerical) to save the result. Or you can use the default, which simply adds _new to the Selected Property name. It is usually best to create a new property and give it a descriptive name. Entering the source property name overwrites the existing data, which may be appropriate in some cases. Check the sample input and output property values for the formula (displayed beneath the Selected Property and New Property Name, respectively) to see that the formula returns values you expect. If the input property value is invalid for a selected formula the area below the new property name displays a brief description of the problem. In this example, we’ll run just one formula. However, at this point, you can: Add more formulas (for example to transform other property values available in the selected Category or Relationship). Delete a formula by clicking its Trash icon. Once you have added all the formulas you want, you can scroll to the bottom of the panel and either: Click Test to run a test and review the results. OR Click Run to create the new property values for the category or relationship. The new property will be added to the selected category or relationship and the calculated value will be added to each node (or edge) that includes valid input. Messages appear below the Run and Test buttons showing the results, including the number of nodes with the new property. Custom formulas enable you to use javascript functions to handle complex data conversions, and also to bring multiple properties into a single property. The libraries Lodash.js and Moment.js are supported. Examples use the open-source dataset for the HBO Game of Thrones series. For a hands-on exercise see our How to GraphXR tutorials. We’ll use a custom formula to reformat existing properties in our dataset and write them to a new seasonEpisode property. First we import two CSV files by drag and drop: Lines.csv, with details about dialog spoken in the show. In the imported the Lines category, season and episode number are combined into a single seasonEpisode property as a text string (e.g. 'S1E3'). Episodes.csv, with details about the show’s episodes. In the imported Episodes category, seasonNumber and episodeNumber are separate properties with integer values (e.g. '1'). We want these combined into a single string and written to a new seasonEpisode property to match Lines. To run a custom formula to create a new property: Deselect all the data in the graph space to ensure that the transform applies to all nodes or edges of a specified Category or Relationship. Open the Transform panel and f(x) tab. Click Category and select the Episodes category from the dropdown menu. Click episodeNumber in the list of properties to add it to the Selected Property list and display your Input Formula options. In the New Property Name textbox, enter seasonEpisode. Select toCustom from the Input Formula menu, and enter the following javascript formula: (propVal,props) => 'S'+props.seasonNumber+'E'+props.episodeNumber As you enter a formula, a sample result appears beneath the new property name. If there is a problem with the formula or the source data, a brief message appears (for example, \"Invalid input\"). Click Test to test the custom function, or Run to run it. In either case a message shows the result of the transformation, including the number of nodes with the new property. To inspect the new seasonEpisode property and its values, open the Table panel and select the Episodes category.
