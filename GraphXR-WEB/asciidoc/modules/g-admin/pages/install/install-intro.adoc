= Installing GraphXR

Installing GraphXR is only necessary for Enterprise accounts that require a secure on-premises application. The application package is accessed through Docker, and then installed. 

Individual users can simply go to the GraphXR browser, create an account and log in.

Using GraphXR in a virtual reality space through WebX requires additional software and hardware installation.
