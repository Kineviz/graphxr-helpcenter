= GraphXR Administration

Admin accounts can be provided for GraphXR multi-user installations. They are configured and registered during installation. However, admin privileges can be updated without requiring re-installation.

* Manage users, roles, and security.
* Track GraphXR usage.
* Manage Neo4j datasets.
* Review and respond to user email feedback.* Create and manage user Surveys.
* Review and manage *_Extensions_*.
* Review and respond to user email feedback.
* Manage custom *_Icon_* sheets.
* Create and manage project *_Templates_* that can be applied when creating or editing a project.
* Create and manage *_Short URL_* lists for shared views or iFrames.
