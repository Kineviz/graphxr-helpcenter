You can:

* *_Add_* a user.
* *_Remove All Inactive Users_*
* Edit a user profile to update user email, name, access, status, and type.
* Search for one or more users:
** Enter all or part of a user email.
** Select a time period during which the users were active.
** Select *_User Status_* or *_User Type_* from the dropdown menus.
* Export information for one or more users as a .CSV file.
* Modify the DB authorization for selected users.

== Add a User

When an email server has been configured, each user of GraphXR must have a user account. A user who does not already have an account is prompted for a user name and password when logging in to GraphXR.

If no email server is configured, users only need a url to access GraphXR. This can provide shared use or a read-only account.

*To add a user:*

. Log in to your Admin account, and go to *https://localhost:8080/admin*
+
The Users tab opens with a list of all users currently registered in the system.

+

* *_Email_*: The email used to sign in to the account.
* *_First Name_* and *_Last Name_*: The user's first and last name.

* *_Plan Days_*: Indicates the number of days remaining on the user's subscription plan.
* Set *_Access_* to _Active_, _Inactive_, _Reset_, or _Freeze_.
* Set the *_UserType_* to _Normal_ or _Admin_.

NOTE: Clicking the *_X_* to close the window also cancels any changes.
