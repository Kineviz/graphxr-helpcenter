* *_Import_*, and *_Add_* extensions individually.
* *_Search_* for extensions by time period, name or description, then *_Pull The Extensions From GraphXR Manager Server_*.
* *_Delete_* an extension from your installation.
* *_Edit_* the version of the extension being used.

NOTE: As the administrator, you can create project *_Templates_* to restrict the availability of extensions within a project. In addition, general users with access to the *_UI Configuration_* button in the projectâ€™s *_Settings_* panel can adjust visibility of extensions from within a project.
