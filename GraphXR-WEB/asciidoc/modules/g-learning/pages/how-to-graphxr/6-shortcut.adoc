| Before working with the *_Shortcut_* transform, we'll load the Snapshot we took in our previous session right before merging. Click the expand/collapse arrow in the Snapshots title bar, then click snapshot's cloud icon.

| 4
| Now we'll use *_Shortcut_* to create a simpler graph focused on characters and the episodes in which they have appeared. Open the *Transform* panel and *Shortcut* tab.

| 5
| To create a shortcut, you first need to select at least one center node of an edge-node-edge pattern. Click Lines in the Legend to select all the Lines nodes.

| 6
| Here we'll shortcut the SPOKE-Lines-SPOKEN_ON pattern to a new APPEARED_ON relationship that will connect Characters to Episodes. We can copy properties from Lines to APPEARED_ON, but here we don't need to. Enter the pattern and click *Run*.

| 7
| We've now added the new APPEARED_ON  relationship but our source pattern is still present. Click *_Category_* on the Legend and _Lines_ to select all nodes of that category.

| 8
| With _Lines_ selected, press your delete key, or click the *Delete* icon.

| 9
| This removes all _Lines_ nodes and their connected SPOKE and SPOKEN_ON edges. We've now re-modeled the graph patterns to focus on characters and episodes. Save a snapshot, and we'll continue with this data in _Module 7. Preferences._
