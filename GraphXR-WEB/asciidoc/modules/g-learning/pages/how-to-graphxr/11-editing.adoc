| *Slide* | *Text*

| 3
| You can create new data or edit existing data in the graph space.  +
And you can select and delete nodes and edges at any time.  Let's add some data.

| 4
| *Add Node* lets you add one new node at a time. *Add Edge* lets you add one or more edges at a time. You can create new node or edge properties and enter their values.

| 5
| Click *Add Node* in the toolbar. You can create a new category or choose an existing one, and enter values for existing properties or create new ones. We'll add a House node and add its _houseName_ property. Click *Create* to see the new node.

| 6
| Now we can connect a few Characters to the new House node. Click the *Add Edge* icon in the toolbar.

| 7
| Enter a relationship name or select an existing one. We'll add BELONGS_TO edges.  +
Select the Character nodes to be connected and click *As Source*, then our new House node and click *As Target*.

| 8
| You can click *Switch* to reverse the direction of the relationship. And you can enter property names if desired. We don't need to do either one.  +
Now click *Create* to see your new edges.

| 9
| The selected Character nodes are now connected to the House node we created by new BELONGS_TO edges.

| 10
| To remove selected nodes and their edges, at any time you can click the *Delete* icon or use your keyboard delete key.

| 11
| You can edit your graph data directly using a table. First though, take a *Snapshot*.  +
Now open the *Table* panel, then click *Enhanced Table*.

| 12
| The *Enhanced Table* editor lets you edit, add, or remove graph data. Changes take effect immediately in the graph. +
 +
Click the Airplane icon to display the *Enhanced Table* in a new window.

| 13
| Click any *Category* or *Relationship* bubble to edit its label.

| 14
| Click the property menu to select properties to display in the table. Click the *x* on a property label to hide it.

| 15
| Any property value can be edited.  +
The change takes effect immediately in the graph.

| 16
| Click the square at the far left to select rows, then click *More Actions* and *Mark Selected in Graph* to show only those nodes or edges in the basic table and to select them in the graph.

| 17
| Click *More Actions* and *Remove* to delete selected nodes or edges from the table and from the graph.

| 18
| At any time, you can click *More Actions* and *Export CSV* to export all or part of the data as a CSV file.  +
Now dismiss the *Enhanced Table* window to return to the project space.

| 19
| Any edits in the *Enhanced Table* are now included in the graph.  +
Next, in _Module 12. Geospatial Mapping_, we'll work with GraphXR features for displaying data on a world map.
