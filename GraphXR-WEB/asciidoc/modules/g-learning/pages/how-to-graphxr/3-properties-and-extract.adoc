| In this Session... | Before you begin...

a| * Inspecting properties.
* Using *_Extract_* to model new categories and relationships from properties.
* Exporting data and saving data Views.

| To follow along, you can download:

Unzip, and drag and drop the _Characters.csv_ file to a project space.

| When we drop _Characters.csv_ on the graph space, columns in the spreadsheet (name, houseName, etc become properties of the nodes. For a table of the nodes and their properties, click *_Table_* on the *_Main Menu_*, and the *_Category_* label.

| 4
| We can use a property to define a new category and relationship and extract new nodes and edges connected to the original Character nodes.

| 5
| Let's switch to Property view. In the Legend, click the *_Property_* tab. A dropdown menu with the first property name appears. Below it is a scrollable list of each unique value for that property in the graph.

| 6
| The _houseName_ property has just a few unique values, one for each of the great houses (families) in Game of Thrones. Now let's create nodes for the Houses. Open the *_Transform_* panel \=> *_Extract_* tab.

| 7
| The *_Transform_* panel includes some of GraphXR's most powerful capabilities, letting you interactively model your data. Transforms affect the whole graph if nothing is selected. If you make a  selection, a transform operates on only those elements.

| 8
| We'll create a House category from the _houseName_ property, and a BELONGS_TO relationship in the process that links House nodes to their Character node sources.

| 9
| Set _houseName_ as a key so that a single node is created for each unique value of _houseName_, and not a separate one for every source node. Now click *_Run_*.

| 10
| In the Legend, click the *_Category_* and *_Relationship_* tabs. You'll see that a node has been created for each House, and Character nodes are now connected to a House via edges of the BELONGS_TO relationship.

| 11
| Click the *_Property_* tab, and notice that Characters with an empty _houseName_ property value are assigned to a House labeled _not available_. If you click the *skip empty* checkbox before extracting, those Character nodes remain unconnected.

| 12
| This is a good time to save our work! Open the *Project* panel \=> *Data* tab. You can download the current state of your graph as a GraphXR (GXRF) file, export it as a group of CSVs ( or write back to a Neo4j database, if you have connected to one).

| 13
| You can also save to the cloud by creating a View. Enter a descriptive name and click *_Save  View_*. The current view is highlighted.  +
You can load any saved view, update or delete it, and share it with another user.

| 14
| Now that we've saved our progress, let's go on to _Module 4: Link and Filter_ and bring in more data.
