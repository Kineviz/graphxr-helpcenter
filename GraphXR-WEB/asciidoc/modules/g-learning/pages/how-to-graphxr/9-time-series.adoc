| 3
| Open a *_Table_* to see that our Episodes nodes include an _episodeAirDate_ property. To visualize time series in the graph we can use parametric or geometric layouts to order nodes by date-time property values. We can also filter nodes by a date or date range.

| 4
| First, we'll go to *_Project\=>Category_* and click _Episodes_. We'll set _episodeAirDate_ values as captions and scale the nodes by the _millionViewers_ property value.

| 5
| Open a Table to review _episodeAirDate_ property values.  +
GraphXR's preferred format for a date and time stamp is  YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.  +
We can edit incorrect data formats either manually or using a preset *Transform*.

| 6
| If just one or a few dates are in the wrong format, you can simply edit the property value, either in the node's Information window, or an *Enhanced Table*.

| 7
| If most or all dates need reformatting, you can use a preset formula in *Transform\=>f(x)*.  +
In the *Transform* panel \=> *f(x)* tab select the category (Episodes) and property (e.g. _episodeAirDate)_ that has the date-time data you need to transform.

| 8
| Select the *_toDate_* or *_convertCustomDate_* *_Input Formula_*. Enter a *_New Property Name_* for the converted data.  A sample result appears below.  Then click *_Test_* to test the transformation or *_Run_* to perform it.

| 9
| Now open the *Layout\=> Parametric* tab. Select _episodeAirDate_ and _millionViewers_ for X and Y axes and _totalCharacters_ for the Z axis, then click *_Apply_*.  +
Next we can apply a filter to isolate nodes with specific date property values.

| 10
| Open the *_Filter_* panel. To filter Episode nodes by air dates (or range of air dates), select _episodeAirDate_ in the *_Node Property_* menu.

| 11
| You can manually scrub through the values using the handles, or use the playback controller to play through values (or a locked range). This lets us animate filtered data and share the animation with other users as a view.

| 12
| Filters also provide effective visualization when used with the geometric or geospatial layouts that we can apply to different categories of nodes.

| 13
| In the *_Geometric_* tab click *_Order by Property_*, select Episodes and the _episodeAirDate_ property, click *_Ascend_*, and click *_Grid_*.   +
You can then use *_Expand_* on the *_Quick Layout_* toolbar menu to expand the grid.

| 14
| Now repeat the process to lay out Character nodes in a spiral, and House nodes in a line. Then, in the Legend, select both categories using *_ctrl+left click_*, and move those nodes off the grid using *_left click+ drag_*.

| 15
| Now open the *_Filter_* panel and again select _episodeAirDate_ in the *_Node Property_* menu to filter Episode nodes by date. Notice that we can apply multiple filters for any numerical or date property (e.g. the _kills_ property of Character nodes).

| 16
| Let's filter on a range of a 2-month period. Use the handles to set a range, or click the the *_Min_* or *_Max_* fields to select a precise date and time. Select *_Lock Range_* to filter data in 2-month intervals.

| 17
| Again, scrub through the values using the handles, or use the playback controller to play through values (or a locked range).

| 18
| Click the trash can icon on the filters to clear them and display all the data again.

| 19
| Next, in _Module 10. Algorithms_, we'll look at how to measure graph patterns in terms of connectedness, paths, and grouping of nodes.
