| 3
| Open the *_Algorithm_* panel to run a variety of commonly used graph algorithms against your data.  Algorithms are organized in *_Path Finding_*, *_Centrality_*, and *_Community Detection_* tabs.

| 4
| The *_Path Finding_* tab provides an algorithm to highlight the shortest path between the two sets of nodes.

| 5
| Select starting nodes and click *_Add to Start_*, then select ending nodes and click *_Add to End_*. Now click *_Trace Path_*.

| 6
| With a complicated graph it can be hard to see the path. You can click the *_Spotlight Path_* toggle to see only the nodes and edges involved in the path.

| 7
| Click *_Un-spotlight Path_* to see the entire graph again.
+
*TIP:* You can *_Tag_* the spotlit path nodes or take a *_Snapshot_*.

| 8
| A brief aside: the *_Trace Neighbor_* toolbar icon provides another way to explore the paths from selected nodes (but not to a specified set of ending nodes).

| 9
| Select one or more nodes and click the *_Trace Neighbor_* toolbar icon. A slider control shows the number of path steps in the graph, and lets you choose the number to highlight.

| 10
| You can click *_Select Visible_* to select the highlighted path, then click *_Inverse_* and *_Hide Selected_* to hide the data not on the highlighted path. Now back to algorithms...

| 11
| *_Centrality_* algorithms include *_Degree_*, *_PageRank_*, *_Betweenness_*, and *_Closeness_*. Simply click to run, and a property and value for that algorithm will be added to all the nodes in the graph.

| 12
| You can open a *_Table_* to see the new properties, or an *Enhanced Table* to edit and export results.

| 13
| We've already used the *Degree* algorithm and its _gxr_degree_ property to filter out nodes with no connections from the graph. You can also use the property to focus on the most heavily connected nodes in the graph.

| 14
| *_Community Detection_* includes *_Connected Component_*, *_Strong Connected Component_*, *_Louvain_* and *_Label Propagation_* algorithms.

| 15
| Again, click to run and a property and its value for that algorithm is added to all the nodes in the graph.

| 16
| A thorough overview of graph algorithms and their uses is available in: https://neo4j.com/lp/book-graph-algorithms-ms/ . +

Next, in _Module 11. Editing_, we'll dive into details of how to add and edit graph data.
