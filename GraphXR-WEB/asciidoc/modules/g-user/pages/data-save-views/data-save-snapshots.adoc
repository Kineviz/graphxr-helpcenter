= Saving Snapshots

*_Snapshots_* provide a way save up to ten (10) graph states in memory, and re-load any of them during a working session. This is useful for pursuing different lines of investigation from a given starting point, or for saving a variety of layouts. 

Unlike saved data views, snapshots cannot be directly shared. 

The *_Snapshots_* pane floats conveniently in the graph space. You can move it anywhere in the space, and take a snapshot at any time without opening a special panel. Icons on the *_Snapshots_* title bar let you create and save your snapshots in a single click.

The expanded *_Snapshots_* window displays thumbnail previews of each snapshot. Each snapshot includes a number, thumbnail, timestamp, and a *_Note_* field where you can add descriptive text.

You can:

* Click *_Create Snapshot_* to add to your set.
* Click *_Save Snapshots_* to download the entire set as a snapshot archive.
* Click a snapshot *_Trash can_* icon to delete the snapshot.
* Click a snapshot *_Cloud_* icon to load the snapshot.
* Edit a snapshot description in its *_Note_* field.

WARNING: When you exit the project or log out, snapshots are deleted. Before exiting the project space, use *_Save Snapshots_* or the icon on the snapshot bar to export a snapshot archive to your local system. 

== Creating a Snapshot

*To create a snapshot:*

. Go to the *_Settings_* tab in the *_Project_* panel, and click the *_Show Snapshot_* checkbox.
+
The title bar for the *_Snapshots_* window appears at the top right, near the Legend.

== Saving a Snapshot Archive 

You can save your collection of snapshots at any time. Doing so exports a compressed archive (.ZIP) file to your local system that contains each snapshot currently in the set. You can then re-load the entire archived set by drag and drop.

A *snapshot archive* is named _Kineviz-graphxr-snapshots_ , with a _YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS_ timestamp and a  _.graphxrsnapshots_ extension, for example:
+
_Kineviz-graphxr-snapshots 2024-07-17 10-27-46.graphxrsnapshots_
 
WARNING: Be sure to save current snapshots before you import a different archive, because the imported archive replaces the current set.

*To save a snapshot archive:*

* Click *_Save Snapshots_*, or its icon on the snapshot bar.

GraphXR saves the set of snapshots to a file labeled as _Kineviz-graphxr-snapshots YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS.graphxrsnapshots_.


== Loading a Snapshot

Loading a snapshot restores that state of the graph-- both the graph data and its layout. 

You can load any snapshot from the current *_Snapshots_* window. 

The snapshot replaces the current data, and importing an archive by drag and drop replaces the current set of Snapshots. Be sure to:

* Save a snapshot or view of current data if you want to preserve it.
* Save (download) the current set of snapshots before importing a downloaded archive.  

*To load a snapshot:*

. Save a view of current data that you want to preserve. 

.. Either save a snapshot, or if a named view is open, use *_Save_* or *_Save As_* on the *_View_* tab or view menu to save it. 
.. In the view menu choose *_New_* to clear the current data and create a new _Unsaved View_. 
 
. Now open the *_Snapshots_* pane and locate the snapshot you want to load.

. Click the snapshot's *Cloud* icon to load it.

+
The snapshot is loaded to the project space.
+

+

. If desired, go to the view menu or *_Views_* tab and choose *_Save As_* to save the data as a view.
. Enter a name for the view, and click *_Submit_*.

+
NOTE: The creation date for an unsaved view (including those imported from a snapshot or GXRF file) is the current date-time. Optionally, you can click the new view's *_Remark_* icon to include more details about the history of the imported file.
