= Export Data as a CSV or Excel workbook

You can export:

* All the graph data in the project space as a CSV archive of flat files or Excel workbook. 

* All or some of the data in a table as a CSV or Excel file.


== Export all data as CSV or Excel

Exporting a CSV or Excel archive results in a collection of flat files, one for each category and relationship. A category file includes node IDs, properties and their values. A relationship file includes the node source and target IDs, and any edge properties and their values. 

The exported archive or workbook receives a default name of _ProjectName_, _ViewName_ (if any) plus an appropriate extension:

* A *CSV* archive has a _.zip_ extension: _ProjectName_ViewName.zip_
* An *Excel* workbook has an _.xlsx_ extension: _ProjectName_ViewName.xlsx_

*To save a CSV archive or Excel workbook:*

. Click the *_Project_* panel and the *_Data_* tab.
. Click either *_Save CSV_* or *_Save Excel_*.

The file name appears in the Downloads tab of your Chrome browser window.

== Export data from a table

For any single category or relationship, you can export some or all of data that's visible in the project space as a table of nodes or edges and their property values. You can:
 
* Select data in the project space and export the results from a basic table.
* From a basic table, open an *_Enhanced Table_* to further select or edit the data before you export it. 

The exported file receives a default name based on the category or relationship label: _Label(YYYY-MM-DD).xlsx_ or _.csv_ 

For example, _Location(2023-05-02).CSV_ contains a table of _Location_ nodes exported on 2023-05-02.

* To export data from a basic or enhanced table*

. Select data in the project space using any method.
. Open the *_Table_* panel.
+
The *_Category_* tab opens by default, and shows all the categories present in the currently selection (or all visible data if no selection has been made).
