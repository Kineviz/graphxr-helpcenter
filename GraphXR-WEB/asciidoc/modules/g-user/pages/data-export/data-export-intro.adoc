= Export Data

Exporting data from a project may be needed, for example, to provide data to another application or user, or to preserve an external archive of key findings. 

You can export:

* A graph state in GraphXR's GXRF format, essentially saving it as an external data view.

* A xref:./data-save-snapshots[Snapshot] archive. 
 
* A CSV archive or Excel workbook that preserves the nodes, connected edges, and property values visible in the project space (but not the layout).

* A CSV or Excel file of the data available in a category or relationship table.  
  
* The nodes, connected edges, and property values in the data (but not the layout) to the connected Neo4j database.
