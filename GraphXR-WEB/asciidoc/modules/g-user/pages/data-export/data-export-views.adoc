= Export Data Views

GraphXR's GXRF files and snapshot archives enable you to export views that retain the data as well as the 3D layout and perspective of the graph.

NOTE: An archive of current snapshots is exported from the *_Snapshots_* pane or title bar using the *_Save Snapshots_* button or icon. For details see xref:data-save-views/data-save-snapshots[Working with Snapshots]. 
 
In the *_Project > Data_* tab, you can export GXRF files using: 

* *_Save GXRF_* to export a single GXRF file of the data currently in the project space.
* *_Export All Views_* to export all of the project's saved views. 

An exported GXRF files receives the _Project_ name, _View_ name (if any) and the _.graphxr_ extension. For example: _Demo2_Crime.graphxr_
 
If the data have not yet been saved as a view, the view name is numbered as the nth view saved from that project. For example: _Demo2 (1).graphxr_
