= Deleting Data

Deleting data from the project space is easily done. You can:
 
* Delete selected nodes and edges.
* Clear all data from the project.
* Clear unused category labels from the *_Project_* panel when no nodes of that category remain in your project.

Deleting data in the graph space does not delete the data you pulled from a Neo4j database. The data model persists, and the _Categories_ and _Relationships_ tabs in the *_Project_* panel still list your defined entity labels.

WARNING: Editing and transformations done in your GraphXR project are lost when you exit a project unless you save the data. You can xref:data-save-views/data-save-views.adoc[save a persistent data view in the project], xref:data-export/data-export-neo4j.adoc[export data to Neo4j], export a xref:data-export/data-export-views.adoc[data view or snapshot archive] or export data as xref:data-export/data-export-csv-excel.adoc[CSV or Excel files].

== Clear All Data

*To clear all data from a project:*

IMPORTANT: You can use *_Ctrl_*+*_Z_* to immediately undo a *_Delete_* or  *_Clear_* action.

== Clean Unused Category Labels

The *_Project_* panel retains category labels even when no nodes of that category remain in your project. You can use the *_Clean_* button to clean out unused labels.

*To remove unused category labels:*

. Open the *_Project_* panel, select the category bubble, and click the *_Clean_* button.
