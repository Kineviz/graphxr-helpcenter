= Create and Edit Data

Graph data can be easily created and edited within GraphXR. At any time you can:

* xref:data-crud/data-add.adoc[Add nodes and edges] and their properties.
* xref:data-crud/data-edit.adoc[Add and edit labels] of categories, relationships, and properties.

For larger-scale data modeling, GraphXR xref:transform-data/intro-transforms.adoc[*Transforms*] use existing category and relationship patterns to create data arranged in new graph patterns. You can:

** Extract a property as a new category and define its connected relationship. 
** Aggregate, merge, or simplify complex patterns.
** Re-format and combine property values as needed.
