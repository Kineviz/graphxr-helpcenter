= Sharing Views Externally

Once you have saved a view you can:

* Share its url directly with others using the *_Project > Views_* tab. Optionally you can require authentication and set a password.
 
* Embed a shared GraphXR view as an iframe on another web page, using the dropdown list of the project's saved views available on the *_Projects_* (Home) page.

== Sharing a Single View

Yu can go to the *_Project > Views_* tab to obtain a view link for an individual view that can be shared with anyone external to the project, even if they do not have a GraphXR login. Optionally, you can protect the view by requiring login and password authentication. 

*To share a view link:*

. Enter the project, and open the *_Project > Views_* tab.

. Locate the view you want to share in the thumbnail tile or list view, and click its *Share view_* icon.

+ 
In the *_Share..._* dialog you can simply click *_Copy Link_* to copy a url that you can email to another user. You have the option to require authentication such that the user must log in, and must have a password to open the view.

----
<iframe id="iframe-id-graph" src="VIEW URL GOES HERE" height="600px" width = "100%"></iframe>
<script>
let graphXRIframe = document.getElementById("iframe-id-graph");
graphXRIframe.addEventListener('mouseover', function () {
    window.document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
    graphXRIframe.style.overflow = 'auto';
});
graphXRIframe.addEventListener('mouseout', function () {
    window.document.body.style.overflow = 'auto';
    graphXRIframe.style.overflow = 'hidden';
})
</script>
