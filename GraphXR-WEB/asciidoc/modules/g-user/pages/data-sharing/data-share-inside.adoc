= Sharing Project Views

You can share any project with other GraphXR users. Once shared, its data views are available to the invited users. 

== Granting Shared Access to a Project

Projects are not shared by default. You must explicitly grant shared access, and set a sharing configuration that sets the navigation and editing capabilities that will be available to sharing users.

*To share a project and its data views:*

. Go to the *_Projects_* (Home) page, locate the project you want to share, and click its *_Enable Share_* icon (the lock icon at the lower right of the project label).

+
The lock icon changes to *_DisableShare_*, and additional *_GoToShare_*, *_Invite_*, and *_ShareUIConfig_* icons appear.
+

. Click the project's *_ShareUI Config_* icon to display the dialog to review the project's sharing configuration.

+
By default, all user interface functions are enabled.

. Click the icon next to the functions you want removed for share users. This cycles through the following options: 

+
* Enabled on the project and for shared users.
* Enabled on the Project
* Disabled

+

. Click *_Save_*, or click the arrow icon at the upper left to exit the dialog without making changes.

. Now click the projects's *_Invite_* icon to send an email invitation to another GraphXR user.

When the recipient accepts the invitation, the project appears in the *_Shared Projects_* area on their *_Projects_* page.

== Accessing a Shared Project or View

After you are invited to share a project, the project tile appears on your *_Projects_* page in the *_Shared Projects_* area. Your ability to navigate or edit the view is determined by the project's sharing configuration.

You can simply enter the project and go to the *_Views_* tab to see all the project's data views. Alternatively, in the *_Projects_* page you can select an individual view from the project's *_Share_* menu. This automatically opens the project and loads the view. 

=== Loading a Shared View

When you already know the view you want to work with, you can select it in the *_Projects_* page.  

*To load a shared project view:*

. In the *_Projects_* (Home) page, locate the project in the *_Shared Projects_* area.
. Click the project's *_Share_* icon to display a menu of the views saved in that project.

+
. Select a view from the menu.
+
The project automatically opens with the selected view loaded.

=== Entering a Shared Project

You can enter a shared project without loading a view first. Once in the project, you can load a view from the list in the *_Views_* tab. 

*To enter a shared project without loading a view:*

. In the *_Projects_* (Home) page, locate the project in the *_Shared Projects_* area.
. Click the project tile to enter the project.
. Go to the *_Project_* panel and *_Views_* tab, locate a saved view, and click the view's thumbnail tile or list item.
