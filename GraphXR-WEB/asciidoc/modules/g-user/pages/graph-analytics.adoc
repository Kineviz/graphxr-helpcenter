= Using Graph Analytic Algorithms

The *_Algorithm_* panel provides a selection of graph algorithms widely used in graph analytics, organized in *_Path Finding_*, *_Centrality_* and *_Community Detection_* tabs.

* The *_Path Finding_* algorithm traces the path between a set of selected start and end nodes and applies an optional weight.
* *_Centrality_* and *_Community Detection_* algorithms evaluate each node in the graph and return a numerical measure of its connectedness or grouping.

== Using Path Finding

The *_Path Finding_* algorithm traces the shortest path between selected start and end nodes. If relationships in the path have a property that can be used as a weighting factor, you can select a path weighting factor. The nodes and edges on the path are traced and selected.

Once a path has been successfully traced, you can click *_Spotlight Path_* to display only the nodes and edges involved.

*To find a path between connected nodes:*

. Open the *_Algorithm_* panel and *_Path Finding_* tab.

. Select one or more starting nodes in the graph, and click *_Add to Start_*. +
Your selected nodes are listed in *_Start Nodes_*. +
*Note:* An error message displays if you select too many start and end nodes such that there are more than ten pairs for tracing the shortest path.
. Now select ending nodes in the graph, and click *_Add to End_*. +
The selected nodes are listed in *_End Nodes_*. +
*Note:* You can click *_Remove Start Node_* or *_Remove End Node_* to delete your current selection and choose other nodes.
. In the *_Weight Property_* menu you can select a property of one of the relationships in the path to be used as a path weighting value, or leave the default *_Ignore Weight Property_* selected. If the relationships have no properties (which is often the case), *_Ignore Weight Property_* will be the only choice.
. Click *_Trace Path_* to display and select the nodes and edges for the shortest path(s) between your start and end nodes.

. Click *_Spotlight Path_* to display only the nodes and edges in the path. The button label changes to *_Un-spotlight Path_*.
+

. At this point, you can tag the path, and save the tag as a property so that you can easily find it again. You may also want to save and share a data *_View_*, export a *_GXRF_* file, or save and export a *_Snapshot_*.

. Once you are done inspecting the path, click *_Un-spotlight Path_* to return the all the data to the graph. Note that the path will no longer be selected. However, the start and end nodes persist in the *_Path Finding_* tab until you remove them, so you can click *_Trace Path_* again.

NOTE: To find a path between a single start and end node, select the two nodes, then select *_Find Path_* from the right-click menu. Then, to isolate (i.e. spotlight) the path, select *_Inverse_*, then *_Hide Selection_*. You can now tag the path and/or save the view as needed. For a path with a single start and end node this might be faster than opening the *_Path Finding_* algorithm panel. 

== Using Centrality or Community Detection

GraphXR includes a selection of commonly used *_Centrality_* or *_Community Detection_* algorithms, which are designed to calculate measures of connectedness (both with respect to distance and strength of connection) in multi-dimensional data. There are many such algorithms, and each has its own characteristic behavior and strengths.

When you run a *_Centrality_* or *_Community Detection_* algorithm the computed result is added as a property to each node in the graph. The following table lists the available algorithms and the property names GraphXR uses to store the results.

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
| Algorithm Type | Algorithm | Property Name

| Centrality
| PageRank
| pageRank

| Centrality
| Betweenness
| betweenness

| Connected Component
| componentId

| Community Detection
| Strong Connected Component
| strongComponentId

The numerical results can be displayed (for example, in a scatter plot), accessed for other processes within GraphXR, or exported for use in other graph analytics or statistics applications.

*To run a Centrality or Community Detection algorithm:*

. In the *_Algorithm_* panel, click to open the *_Centrality_* or *_Community Detection_* tab.

. Click the button for the algorithm you want to run.
+
A message displays when the calculation is finished. The property and calculated value is added to each node in the graph. To see the results, you can:

* Open a table.
