= Tagging Selected Nodes

Use *_Tag_* to create a label for any selection of nodes. This lets you group any set of nodes you consider related in some way. More than one tag can be added to a node.

To create a tag, you must first select nodes, then use the *_Tag_* icon in the context menu to show the *_ManagerTags_* dialog. You can then:

* Create a tag (i.e. tag the selected nodes). 
* Add (or remove) selected nodes to an existing tag.
* Use *_Save Tags As Property_* to add the temporary property __graphxrtags_ to all currently tagged nodes. When a tag is deleted, the property is removed from its tagged nodes.
* Use *_Clean Nodes Tags_* to delete all the tags on selected nodes.

Tags appear in the legend under *_Tag_*, labeled with a color, name, number of nodes with that tag, and number that are currently selected. GraphXR automatically assigns a color for each tag. In the graph, a tagged node receives a small label listing its tag names.

== Creating a new tag

*To create a tag:*

. Select one or more nodes using any selection method.
. Click the *_Tag_* toolbar icon or select *_Actions>Tag_* in the right-click menu to display the *_Manager Tags_* dialog.
+
 Existing tag names are displayed along with the number of tagged nodes for each.
+

. Enter a unique name for the tag in the textbook and click *_Add Tag_*.
+
The new tag name is displayed above the textbox. In the graph, the tag label appears on the selected nodes.

. Click *_Tag_* in the legend to see the new tag on the list.
+

+
* The tag name is displayed, along with its number of nodes. You can use this to check that you've tagged the expected number of nodes.
* Tags are listed in order of the number of nodes in the tag.

== Saving tags as a temporary property

Optionally, you can click *_Save Tags As Property_* to add the temporary __graphxrtags_ property to all currently tagged nodes. You can then select the _graphxrtags_ property value in the *_Property_* legend list and apply a persistent color and/or icon to the tags. These choices then also appear in the *_Tag_* list. 

NOTE: If a node has more than one tag, a separate color can be applied in the *_Property_* list for every combination of multiple tags (including the different orders in which tags were added). When you display tagged nodes using the *_Tag_* legend, nodes are displayed with the color and icon of the first tag that was applied (e.g. a node tagged with _Tag2_,  then _Tag 1_ is displayed as _Tag 2_). 


*To save tag names as a temporary property:*

. Select one or more nodes.
. Click the *_Tag_* icon or select *_Actions>Tag_* in the right-click menu to display the *_Manager Tags_* dialog.
. Click *_Save Tags As Property_*.
+

+
A message displays indicating success, and the __graphxrtags_ property is added to the selected tagged nodes, with the tag name as its property value. 
+
In the  *_Property_* legend, you can view the list __graphxrtags_ property values. For nodes with more than one tag, the value is the different tag names separated by colons.
+

. Click the *X* at the upper right to dismiss the *_Manager Tags_* dialog.
. To inspect the __graphxrtags_ property and its values, either:
+
* Display a single node's information window (*_Ctrl_*+*_I_*) or quick info rollover.
* Open a *_Table_* for a group of selected nodes.
+

== Adding or removing a tag

*To add or remove a tag:*

. Select a group of nodes using any selection method.
. Click the *_Tag_* icon or select *_Actions>Tag_* in the right-click menu to display the *_Manager Tags_* dialog.
. Locate a tag name and either:

+
Click the *_+_* icon on the tag label to *add* the tag to the selected nodes.
+
OR
+
Click the *_-_* icon on the tag label to *remove* the tag from the selected nodes.
+
image::/v2_17/04_05_03_TagManagerDone.png[,420,340,role=text-left]
+
The number of tagged nodes for that tag is immediately updated. If the tag has been removed from all nodes, the tag name disappears from the dialog.

. Click the *X* at the top right to dismiss the *_Manager Tags_* dialog.

== Cleaning all tags from selected nodes

You can remove all the tags from any selection of nodes in one step, rather than selecting nodes with specific tags and then deleting that tag individually.

*To clean tags from selected nodes:*

. Select a group of nodes using any selection method.
. Click the *_Tag_* icon or *_Actions>Tag_* in the right-click menu to display the *_Manager Tags_* dialog.
. Click *_Clean Nodes Tags_*.
+
image::/v2_17/04_05_03_TagManagerDone.png[,420,340,role=text-left]
+
All of the tags applied to those nodes are removed.
+

* In the *_Manager Tags_* dialog and in the *_Tag_* legend, the total number of nodes for each tag is updated. If no nodes remain, the tag is deleted.
* In the graph, the tag label is removed from the selected nodes, and when viewed using the *_Tag_* legend, the tag color and icon (if any) is removed.
