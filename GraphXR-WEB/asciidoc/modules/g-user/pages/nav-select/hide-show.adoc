= Hiding Data 

Hiding nodes temporarily can be useful for focusing on subsets of graph data that you may want to work with further, or clear from the graph. You can:

* Use *_Hide Selection_* to hide selected nodes temporarily, and *_Show hidden nodes_* to restore hidden nodes.
* Deselect the *_Visible_* checkbox for a category or relationship to temporarily hide nodes of a category or edges of a relationship.
* Select the *_Exclude_* checkbox for any property of a category or relationship to temporarily exclude it from the data.

== Using Hide Selection and Show Hidden Nodes

The *_Hide selection_* and *_Show hidden nodes_* icons appear next to each other in the context menu. *_Hide Selection_* appears only when nodes are selected Once you hide nodes, the *_Show hidden nodes_* icon appears. Click it to restore all the hidden nodes and edges to the graph, update the total counts in the legend lists, and de-select the data.

*To hide nodes:*

. Select nodes using any selection method.

*To restore hidden nodes:*

* Click the *_Show hidden nodes_* icon in the context toolbar. +
All hidden nodes are restored, and the number of restored nodes and associated edges, as well as their properties and tags are added back to the lists in the legend.

== Using Leaf Trimming

Leaf trimming (*_Ctrl + L_*) is a keyboard command which temporarily hides (or restores) nodes in a selection which are either unconnected or connected by only one edge. *_Ctrl*+*L_* is a toggle control.

*To use leaf trimming:*

. Select nodes using any method. If no selection is made leaf trimming operates on all the data.
. Press *_Ctrl + L_* once to hide the trimmed nodes.
 +
The *_Show hidden nodes_* icon appears, if no other nodes had already been hidden.
. Press *_Ctrl +L_* again to restore the trimmed nodes.
+

NOTE: xref:./collect-nodes.adoc[Collections] now provides enhanced ways to group and work with nodes connected by a single relationship.

== Hiding data by Category or Relationship

By default, nodes and edges in the graph are visible. You can hide all data for a category or relationship temporarily by clicking the *_Visible_* checkbox for an entity in the *_Category_* or *_Relationship_* tab of the *_Project_* panel.

* For a _category_, all its nodes as well as the connected edges disappear from the view, and both the category name and the name of its relationships disappear from the list in the legend.
* For a _relationship_, all its edges disappear from the graph space, and the relationship name disappears from the list in the legend. Nodes connected to the edges remain in the graph space.

*To hide data by Category or Relationship:*

. Open the *_Project_* panel and *_Category_* (or *_Relationship_*) tab.
. Click a category or relationship label to select it.
. Un-check the *_Visible_* checkbox.

== Hiding or Excluding property data

You can:
