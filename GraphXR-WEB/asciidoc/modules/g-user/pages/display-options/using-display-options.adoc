= Using Display Options

GraphXR provides considerable flexibility in how nodes, edges, and the project space itself is displayed. You can:

* Set the project space to light or dark mode
* Scale the size of nodes, width of edges, and of captions on nodes and edges.
* Select an icon mode to be used for all categories.
* Set a color and icon by category, and a color by relationship, tag, and property value.
* Apply images, videos or GIFs to nodes, if urls are available as a property value of the category.
* Save current display settings in a template available to all projects.
