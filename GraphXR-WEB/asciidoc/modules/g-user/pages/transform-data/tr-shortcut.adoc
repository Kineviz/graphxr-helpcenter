= Simplifying paths with Shortcut

The _Shortcut_ transform connects two nodes that share a common neighbor with a new edge, and in the process creates a new relationship. The source pattern remains, but it can be hidden or deleted. This enables you to simplify a graph without merging nodes.

Generally, for the pattern:

*_(Category A)→[Relationship 1]→(Category B)→[Relationship 2]→(Category C)_*

a new shortcut pattern is created:

*_(Category A)→[New Relationship3]→(Category C)_*, where:

* Categories *_A_*, *_B_*, and *_C_* contain nodes that share a common neighbor,
* *_[Relationship1]_* and *_[Relationship2]_* contain edges of the two relationships, and
* *_[Relationship3]_* contains edges of the new shortcut relationship. If desired, you can select one or more properties from the center category *_(Category B)_* to be added to the new *_[Relationship3]_*. You can also transform the property values using a preset (or _custom_) *_Input Formula_*.

|===
| *Preset* | *Function* | *Format*

| _custom_
| Editable format
| (centerNodePropValues) \=> _.join(centerNodePropValues,"_")

| _take first_
| Copies the first value of another property
| (centerNodePropValues) \=> _.size(centerNodePropValues) > 0 ? centerNodePropValues[0] : null

| _count_
| Calculates a value based on number of connections.
| (centerNodePropValues) \=> _.size(centerNodePropValues)

| _sum_
| Sums the values of the selected property.
| (centerNodePropValues) \=> _.sumBy(centerNodePropValues,d \=> Number(d) \| 0)

| _average_
| Averages the values of the selected property.
| (centerNodePropValues) \=> _.sumBy(centerNodePropValues,d \=> Number(d) \| 0)/(_.size(centerNodePropValues) > 0 ? _.size(neighborPropValues) : 1)

| _range_
| Finds the lowest and highest value of the selected property.
| (centerNodePropValues) \=> `+${_.maxBy(centerNodePropValues, d => Number(d) \\| 0)} - ${_.minBy(centerNodePropValues, d => Number(d) \\| 0)}+`

| _max_
| Finds the maximum value of the selected property.
| (centerNodePropValues) \=> _.maxBy(centerNodePropValues, d \=> Number(d) \| 0)

| _min_
| Finds the minimum value of the selected property.
| (centerNodePropValues) \=> _.minBy(centerNodePropValues, d \=> Number(d) \| 0)

Editing a preset moves it to the _custom_ item, where you can test or run the edited formula.

== Creating a Shortcut

Using the graph pattern for photo assets illustrated above as a basic example, we can use a shortcut pattern to connect _Authors_ (i.e. photographers) directly to the _Locations_ where they took an image_ through a new WORKED_AT relationship.

NOTE: For a hands-on tutorial using a larger dataset, see our xref:g-learning:how-to-graphxr/how-to-graphxr.adoc[How to GraphXR] tutorials. 

*To create a Shortcut:*

. Open the *_Transform_* panel and *_Shortcut_* tab.
. Now enter the following details in the *_Shortcut_* panel: 
* *_R1_* (Relationship 1): select _CREATED_.
* *_(B)_* (Center Category): select _Photos_. 
* *_R2_* (Relationship 2): select _TAKEN_AT_. 
* *_R3_* (Relationship 3, i.e. the new shortcut relationship): enter _WORKED_AT_.
* If desired, you can copy properties from the central category (_Photos_) to the new (_WORKED_AT)_ relationship, and transform the property values using an *_Input Formula_*. +
We'll compute an average rating for the photos taken at each location, and add it as a new _averageRating_ property of the _WORKED_AT_ relationship.
+
• Select the _Rating_ property from the dropdown menu to add it to the *_Selected Property_* list.
* Enter a *_New Property Name_* (_averageRating_). +
* In *_Input Formula_*, select _average_, and edit the input formula to:
+
----
(Rating) => .sumBy(Rating,d => Number(d) || 0)/(.size(Rating) > 0 ? _.size(Rating) : 1)
----
+
* Check the *_Directional Edge_* and *_Count Links_* checkboxes. *_Count Links_* adds an automatic _count_ property to the new relationship which may not always be meaningful. In this example though, it represents the number of photos at a location taken by the connected author.

. Click *_Run_*. Error and completion messages appear below the *_Run_* button.
+

+
The new shortcut pattern has now been created and added to the graph. Note that the source pattern with its _Photos_ nodes are still present in the graph space.

. To see the shortcut graph, click the _Photos_ category on the legend to select its nodes.
+
image::/v2_17/06_06_04_ShortcutNewEdges720.png[,520,520,role=text-left]

. Either click the *_Hide Selected_* icon to hide all the _Photos_ nodes, or the *_Delete_* icon (or *_del_* or *_backspace)_* to delete them from the graph.
+
We now see only _Author_ and _Location_ nodes connected by the new _WORKED_AT_ edges.

. To see added properties, you can display an info panel or quick info rollover for one of the new edges, or display a table of the edges for the new relationship (e.g. _WORKED_AT_).
