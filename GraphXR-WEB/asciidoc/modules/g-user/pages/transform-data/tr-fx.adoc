= Reformatting Data with fx

With graph-based _f(x)_ _functions_ you can calculate values based on existing properties and write the results back to the source nodes or edges. This capability is similar to _formulas_ in Excel and SQL, and _functions_ in a MapReduce framework. An _f(x)_ formula lets you run javascript formulas on a single category or relationship. You select existing properties in the data to create new properties according to pre-defined or custom formulas.

== f(x) Preset formulas

The following table lists the available preset formulas and their general formats.

[cols="1,3,3"]
|===
| *Preset* | *Function* | *Format*

| _toCustom_
| Editable format
| (propVal,props) \=> propVal

| _toNumber_
| String or Number \=> a Number
| (propVal,props) \=> Number(propVal) \| 0

| _toString_
| String, Number, or Date \=> a String
| (propVal,props) \=> String(propVal)

| _toDate_
| Valid date-time \=>  +
a _YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss_ timestamp
| (propVal,props) \=> moment(propVal).format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss')

| _toWeek_
| Valid date-time \=>  +
a weekday (e.g. _Monday_)
| (propVal,props) \=> moment(propVal).format('dddd')

| _convertCustomDate_
| Custom date format _MM,DD,YYYY_ \=> a _YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss_ timestamp
| (propVal,props) \=> moment(propVal, "MM,DD,YYYY").format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss')

| _fullName_
| Combine _firstName_ and _lastName_ property values \=>  +
the new property, as a full name.
| (propVal,props) \=> !props['firstName'] ? propVal : `${props['firstName']}-${props['lastName']}`
|===

Editing a preset moves it to the *_toCustom_* item, where you can test or run the edited formula.

== Running a preset f(x) formula

Formulas apply to a single category or relationship at a time. However, you can run more than one formula at a time on a selection of data.

In the following example numerical data in the file _ImportSample.csv_ has been entered as a text string. We'll use the *_toNumber_* preset to transform the data to numerical values.

*To run preset formulas to create and populate new properties:*

. Deselect all the data in the graph space to ensure that the transform applies to all nodes or edges of a specified Category or Relationship.
. Open the *_Transform_* panel and *_f(x)_* tab.
. Select a _Category_ or _Relationship_ for the data you want to operate on (e.g. _ImportSample_).
. In the *_Apply Formula to Properties_* dropdown, select the property value to transform (e.g. _Score_), or click the *_+_* icon in the table of properties below the dropdown to select it. +
The review panel below the properties shows a sample of existing values and their data formats.
. Choose a preset formula from the dropdown menu, in this case, _*toNumber*,_ to convert the _Score_ text string to a numerical value.
+

. Enter a new property name (e.g. _scoreNumerical_) to save the result. Or you can use the default, which simply adds __new_ to the *_Selected Property_* name.
+

NOTE: It is usually best to create a new property and give it a descriptive name. Entering the source property name overwrites the existing data, which may be appropriate in some cases.

. Check the sample input and output property values for the formula (displayed beneath the *_Selected Property_* and *_New Property Name_*, respectively) to see that the formula returns values you expect.
+

NOTE: If the input property value is invalid for a selected formula the area below the new property name displays a brief description of the problem.

+
* In this example, we'll run just one formula. However, at this point, you can:
**  Add more formulas (for example to transform other property values available in the selected Category or Relationship). +
** Delete a formula by clicking its Trash icon.

. Once you have added all the formulas you want, you can scroll to the bottom of the panel and either:
+
* Click *_Test_* to run a test and review the results. +
OR
+
* Click *_Run_* to create the new property values for the category or relationship. +
The new property will be added to the selected category or relationship and the calculated value will be added to each node (or edge) that includes valid input.
+
Messages appear below the *_Run_* and *_Test_* buttons showing the results, including the number of nodes with the new property.

== Running a custom f(x) formula

Custom formulas enable you to use javascript functions to handle complex data conversions, and also to bring multiple properties into a single property. The libraries https://lodash.com/docs[_Lodash.js_] and https://momentjs.com/docs/[_Moment.js_] are supported.

NOTE: Examples use the open-source dataset for the HBO Game of Thrones series. For a hands-on exercise see our xref:g-learning:how-to-graphxr/how-to-graphxr.adoc[How to GraphXR] tutorials.

We'll use a custom formula to reformat existing properties in our dataset and write them to a new _seasonEpisode_ property. First we import two CSV files by drag and drop:

* _Lines.csv_, with details about dialog spoken in the show. In the imported the _Lines_ category, season and episode number are combined into a single _seasonEpisode_ property as a text string (e.g. 'S1E3').
* _Episodes.csv_, with details about the show's episodes. In the imported _Episodes_ category, _seasonNumber_ and _episodeNumber_ are separate properties with integer values (e.g. '1'). We want these combined into a single string and written to a new _seasonEpisode_ property to match _Lines_.

*To run a custom formula to create a new property:*

. Deselect all the data in the graph space to ensure that the transform applies to all nodes or edges of a specified Category or Relationship.
. Open the *_Transform_* panel and *_f(x)_* tab.
. Click *_Category_* and select the _Episodes_ category from the dropdown menu.
. Click _episodeNumber_ in the list of properties to add it to the *_Selected Property_* list and display your *_Input Formula_* options.
. In the *_New Property Name_* textbox, enter _seasonEpisode_.
. Select _toCustom_ from the *_Input Formula_* menu, and enter the following javascript formula:
+
----
(propVal,props) => 'S'+props.seasonNumber+'E'+props.episodeNumber
----

. As you enter a formula, a sample result appears beneath the new property name. If there is a problem with the formula or the source data, a brief message appears (for example, "Invalid input").
+

. Click *_Test_* to test the custom function, or *_Run_* to run it. +
In either case a message shows the result of the transformation, including the number of nodes with the new property.
+
image::/v2_17/06_01_04_CustomFcnDone1320.png[,720,520,role=text-left]

. To inspect the new _seasonEpisode_ property and its values, open the *_Table_* panel and select the _Episodes_ category. You can also see the new property in a node's information panel.
