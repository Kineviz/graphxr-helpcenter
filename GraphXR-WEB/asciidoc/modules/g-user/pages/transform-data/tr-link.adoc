= Combining data with Link

The *_Link_* transform connects nodes with equivalent property values through edges of a new or existing relationship. Properties can be linked even if the property names differ, which is especially useful for combining data from different sources. *_Link_* can also be used to explicitly draw a connection among nodes within a data set.

NOTE: Examples use the open-source dataset for the HBO Game of Thrones series. For a hands-on exercise see our xref:g-learning:how-to-graphxr/how-to-graphxr.adoc[How to GraphXR] tutorials. 

The Game of Thrones _Characters.csv_ file includes the _characterName_ property, while the _Lines.csv_ file includes the _speaker_ property. Although named differently, the two properties have matching values: the name of the character in the show. We can use those properties to create a relationship between lines of dialog and the character that spoke it.

If a property is missing, or the values do not match, a link will not be created. This can result in nodes remaining unconnected. To correct this, you can select and inspect the unconnected nodes and if appropriate, edit the property values.

*To Link nodes by property value:*

. To operate on the entire data set, deselect all the data.
. In the *_Transform_* panel, open the *_Link_* tab.
. In this example, we'll link characters to the lines they spoke. Select or enter the following details:
* *_Source Category_*: select _Characters_ +
* *_Create Relationship_*: enter _SPOKE_ +
* *_Target Category_*: select _Lines_ +
* *_Source Property_*: select _characterName_ +
* *_Target Property_*: select _speaker_

. Click *_Run_*. Error and completion messages appear below the *_Run_* button.

The new SPOKE relationship appears in the legend, and _Character_ nodes now have new directional SPOKE edges connected to the respective _Lines_ nodes.
