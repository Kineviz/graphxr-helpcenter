= Combining data with Merge

*_Merge_* lets you combine nodes of a single category, or edges of a single relationship based on a property value. This is useful for simplifying a graph quickly.

In our example data we can use the _seasonEpisode_ property in the _Lines_ category to combine all of the lines spoken on a single episode into a single _Lines_ node connected to its _Episodes_ node.

NOTE: Examples use the open-source dataset for the HBO Game of Thrones series. For a hands-on exercise see our xref:g-learning:how-to-graphxr/how-to-graphxr.adoc[How to GraphXR] tutorials. 

*To combine nodes using Merge:*

. Deselect all the data to operate on all the data.
. Open the *_Transform_* panel and *_Merge_* tab.
. Click *_Category_* and select the _Lines_ category from the dropdown menu.
. In the *_Select key properties_* dropdown (or scrollable list), select the _seasonEpisode_ property.

NOTE: The resulting merged node will preserve only one of the values for each property from its source nodes. In most cases, these properties should be cleared by checking the *_Clear Unselected Properties_* checkbox before running the merge.

. Click *_Run_*. Error and progress messages will appear beneath the *_Run_* button.

The graph is now far simpler. Instead of a few thousand nodes, the _Lines_ category now includes only 73 nodes, the number of episodes in the series.
