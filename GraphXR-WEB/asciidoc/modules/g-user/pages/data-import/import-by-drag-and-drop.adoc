= Import Data by Drag and Drop

You can import data in _.CSV_, _.JSON_, GraphXR's _.graphxr_ and _.graphxrsnapshots_, and many other data formats by drag and drop. Simply locate the file on your system, then drag and drop it anywhere in the project graph space.

NOTE: In the *_Project_* panel and *_Data_* tab you can also click *_Import_* or *_Import Views_* to navigate to a file and import the data.

WARNING: Be sure to save any current view before you import data. To do this go to the project view menu and either *_Save_* your current view, or *_Save As_* a new view. If you do unintentionally import data to an existing view, you can immediately use *_Save As_* to create a new view.  

== Importing flat files by drag and drop

When you import data that has no defined graph schema, such as a flat .CSV file, each row is imported as a node of a single default category. 

NOTE: Keep in mind that data from _CSV_ , _Excel_, or _.JSON_ files is *added to* any data already in the project space. To create a new empty view, save your current view, and then select *_New_* from the project view menu. This clears the existing data and opens a new empty _Unsaved View_.    

For example, the following spreadsheet can be dropped onto the project space. It's a travel log with three columns headed _date_, _from_country_, and _to_country_ .

* A node representing a single travel event is created for each row. All the nodes are assigned a single category labeled with the name of the file (i.e. _COVID-19 Travel Log - Sheet1)_.

* The column headings in the file are assigned as property names: _date_, _from_country_, and _to_country_, and property values are transferred for the respective nodes. In the *_Table_* panel, you can inspect the imported nodes and their property values.

Starting with unconnected nodes, you can create connected graph data using GraphXR's navigation, selection, and transformation tools. In particular, the *_Transform_* panel provides powerful ways to extract and/or simplify categories, properties, and  relationships.

== Importing graph data views by drag and drop

You can simply drag and drop graph data held in a JSON file, _CSV_ or _Excel_ archive, _graphxr_ file, or _graphxrsnapshots_ archive. The categories, relationships, and their properties are included. The data in _graphxr_ files or a _graphxrsnapshots_ archive retain the 3D layout and view perspective it had when it was saved. 

WARNING: Keep in mind that data imported from a _.graphxr_ view, _.graphxrsnapshots_ archive, or data _View_  *replaces* any data already in the project space. Be sure to save (or  export) your current view before you import a view. 

You can:

* Use the view menu or *_Views_* tab to save your view, or
* Go to the *_Project_* panel and *_Data_* tab and choose *_Save GXRF_*, *_Save CSV_*, *_Save Excel_* or, if a database is connected to your project, *_Save Neo4j_*.

== Importing Snapshots

Once a snapshot archive has been saved, you can simply restore it to your project by drag and drop. 

*To import a snapshot archive:*

. Open a GraphXR project.
. Locate the _.graphxrsnapshots_ archive file, and drag and drop it on your project's graph space.
+
The set of snapshots appear in the *_Snapshots_* window, and the most recent snapshot is imported to the graph space.
+

WARNING: Existing data if any is replaced with the most recent snapshot view. 

. You can import any of the snapshots in the archived set as your new starting point. Click the arrow on the left edge of the *_Snapshots_* window to expand the archive and locate the snapshot you want.
+

. Click the snapshot's *cloud* icon to import it.

IMPORTANT: When you exit or log out, snapshots are deleted. Before you exit the project space, use *_Save Snapshots_* to export a snapshots archive to your local system that you can then import by drag and drop.
