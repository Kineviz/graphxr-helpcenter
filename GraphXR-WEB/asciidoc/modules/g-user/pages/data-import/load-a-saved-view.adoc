= Load a Saved View

Once a view has been saved, you can load it into the project at any time. It will include the nodes and edges as well as the 3D perspective and layout of the graph as it was when the view was last saved.  

NOTE: A data view is automatically available only in the project where it was created. However, you can import views that have been exported as a GXRF file or Snapshot archive  to another project. Data saved as a CSV or Excel archive can also be imported to another project, except that its 3D layout is not preserved.

WARNING: Loading a view replaces any data that are already in the project space. Before you load a saved view be sure to save your current view. You can save it back to the current view, save it as a new view, or export it as a GXRF file or snapshot archive.  


*To load a saved view:*

. Open the *_Project_* panel and *_View_* tab.
