= Graph Data Basics

Graph data expresses information as *_patterns_* built from entities, connections, and  their associated properties. A GraphXR project provides a virtual 3D space for viewing and working with such graph patterns.

Visualizing patterns in terms of both direction and multi-hop connections can quickly provide insight that is difficult or impossible to discover in tables or hierarchical data structures. And a graph data model can be easily extended and modified.

== The Labeled Property Graph

GraphXR supports a *labeled property graph* model, in which patterns are composed of three elements: _nodes_, _edges_, and _properties_.

*_Nodes_* are entities representing things like _people_ or _events_. All nodes of a given type comprise a *_Category_* with a single label, such as _Location_ that identifies it in GraphXR. Each node appears on a GraphXR project canvas as a circle, colored and styled according to its category.  

*_Edges_* are connections between nodes, such as TAKEN_AT or TAKEN_BY. All edges of a given type comprise a *_Relationship_*. Each edge is represented by a line connecting two nodes, colored according to its relationship. Directed relationships such as PARENT_OF have an arrow at one end, while directionless ones such as FRIENDS_WITH do not.

*_Properties_* in a labeled property graph are key-value pairs associated with nodes or edges. Properties include a key such as *_placeName_* or *_country_*, and a value. Property values can be in the form of numbers, text, geospatial coordinates, date or time. Multiple values can be entered for a property of a node or edge. The properties of individual nodes can be reviewed in a table or information panel, and displayed as captions or a url image.

== Sources of Graph Data

Data can be added to your graph from many different sources. You can:

* Pull or query graph data from a graph database connected to GraphXR, or load data exported from other graph databases or another GraphXR project. Data exported from a graph database will include its defined categories, relationships, and properties.

* xref:data-import/import-by-drag-and-drop.adoc[Import data] in CSV, JSON, and many other formats simply by drag and drop. When you import data that has no associated graph model, such as a flat CSV file, each row in the table is imported as a node of a single default category. In most cases, you will then re-model data imported by drag and drop using GraphXR transforms.

* xref:data-crud/data-add.adoc[Add new nodes and edges] of existing or new categories or relationships directly in GraphXR. Normally, this is only done for very small amounts of data.
* xref:data-crud/data-edit.adoc[Edit] category, relationship, or property labels, and edit property values.

== Graph Data Modeling

The property graph data model is both flexible and extensible. Since data exploration and analysis is highly iterative, this is a powerful advantage. New categories, relationships, and properties can be added, and old ones re-defined as investigation and analysis proceeds.  

* GraphXR's xref:data-import/import-using-a-mapping.adoc[*Mapping Editor*] lets you construct graph patterns from the columns in a flat CSV file or relational database table, and apply the model during import. Your mapping is saved and can be re-used and edited. It can even be applied to other tabular files that have content labeled in the same way.

* Once data have been imported, you can
** xref:data-crud/data-edit.adoc[Edit] category, relationship, or property labels, and edit property values.

** Use GraphXR xref:transform-data/intro-transforms.adoc[*Transforms*] to quickly define and apply new data models. You can:

*** Extract a property as a new category and define its connected relationship. 
*** Aggregate, merge, or simplify complex patterns.
*** Re-format and combine property values as needed.
