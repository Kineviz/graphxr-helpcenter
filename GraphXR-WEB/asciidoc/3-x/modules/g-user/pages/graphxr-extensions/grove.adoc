= Grove

Grove provides developers with a javascript authoring environment that runs in the browser along with GraphXR. With Grove, you can develop Observable-inspired javascript notebooks that deliver reproducible, interactive data visualization, discovery and analysis. These can include customer-facing (read-only) dashboards, as well as collaborative (code-sharing) notebooks for data discovery and analytics. 
 
For developers, Grove leverages https://observablehq.com/@anjana/functional-javascript-first-steps[functional JavaScript] and open-source visualization packages such as https://d3js.org[D3], https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/[Vega-Lite], https://plotly.com/[Plotly], and https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introducing-observable-plot[Observable Plot] to delve deeper into high-dimensional data. 

The *_Grove Demo_* project includes example notebooks that developers can explore and copy to jump-start development of their own notebooks. 

A *_Grove API_* provides access to GraphXR functions needed to load, transform, and display graph data.

== Grove Demo Quick Tour

Example notebooks in the *_Grove Demo_* project use publicly available sample data sets to demonstrate Grove basics such as:

* Connecting graph data + local CSV/JSON files to your Grove notebook.
* Using the Grove API to filter large datasets
* Using open-source infographic libraries
* Building interactive search tables

=== Opening a Grove notebook

*To open a Grove demo notebook:*

. Log in to GraphXR and open the *_Grove Demo_* project.
. Go to the *_Project_* panel and *_Extensions_* tab, and select *_Grove_* from the dropdown menu.
. Click the *_Notebooks_* icon (*_ctrl+Alt+P_*) at the upper right to see demo Notebooks.
+
Click the *_Overview_* or *_Share_* tabs to see notebooks available in the demo, either in tile or list view.
+

. Click to select a demo notebook. (e.g. _Map_, entitled _Geospatial Analysis_), and dismiss the *_Notebooks_* panel. The selected notebook displays in the split screen. To use more of the screen you can click the *_Full Screen_* icon at the upper right to use the entire screen, or the *_Airplane_* icon to display the notebook in a separate window.

=== Navigating the notebook

A Grove notebook consists of cells of Observable-inflected javascript code. The code does not have to execute in the order it appears. Instead, cells that display results or require user interaction can be placed at the top, and other processing code can be organized in cells below, often in an Appendix.

The simple _Map_ notebook above loads geospatial data for counties, and displays the data on a map, colored by region. A *_Load Counties_* button appears below the map.

* Roll over the small circles at the far right margin to see names of the cells in the notebook. Clicking a circle takes you to the code cell. In this notebook, a GraphXR API call is used, and Vegalite and D3 javascript packages provide data parsing and geospatial mapping.
* Title bars located at the top of the window provide information about the project and the open notebook, ways to navigate Grove functions and to edit the code.
+

NOTE: The top bar is divided into two, depending on the size of your browser window.

==== Title bar functions

Depending on the width of your browser you see one or two title bars at the top that display:

* The notebook name.
* Browser *_history_* icon. Click to display a list of the notebooks you've opened recently.
* A *_close_* icon to close and exit the notebook.
* Notebooks *_Panel_* icon, to display notebooks available to the project.
* *_Folder_* icon, to navigate to the Grove project folder.
* *_More_* icon (three dots), for a dropdown menu of additional functions:
 ** *_Screen Shot_*, to take a screen shot of onscreen display.
 ** *_Print_*, to print the displayed results.
 ** *_Import Files_*, to browse and select data to be imported.
 ** *_Export All_*, to export the entire notebook and its data in a .zip file.
 ** *_Help_*, for a useful list of keyboard shortcuts for many notebook actions, organized under *_File Actions_*, *_Editing Code_*, and *_Cell Shortcuts_* headings.
 ** *_Safe Mode_* a code-only view that lets you work with issues that could crash or hang the normal editor.
 ** *_Full Screen_*, to toggle between full screen and split screen mode.
 ** *_Settings_*, to set various project-wide settings such as auto-save frequency, default star and access permissions, and the code theme used.
* Badges for the contributors to the notebook.
* *_View Code_* and *_Edit Code_* icons. This displays the javascript code cells and makes them editable.

An additional title bar includes information and action icons for the notebook, including:

* *_Version_* icon. Click to display a *_Version Control_* history for this notebook.
+

* *_Publish_* (globe) icon. Click to display a *_Publish Settings_* dialog where you can change the permission level for the notebook or unpublish it.
* The latest published time
* File *_attachments_*, and connected databases(available only in private notebooks).
* The last publication time, folder location, and size of the notebook.

=== Accessing shared notebooks

Once you share a notebook, it appears under the *_Share_* tab in the Notebooks panel.

You can also access a shared notebook under the *_Grove Links_* tab. This may be a more immediate way to explore a shared notebook.

*To open a Grove Link notebook:*

. Go to the GraphXR *_Project_* panel and *_Grove Links_* tab.
. Click the airplane icon next to the Notebook name (e.g. _Import NYERSDA csv_).
+
The notebook opens in a separate window.
+

. Click the *_Load Data_* button in the example notebook, which loads selected csv data to the GraphXR graph space.
+

If desired, you can review the code or make a copy of the example notebook.
