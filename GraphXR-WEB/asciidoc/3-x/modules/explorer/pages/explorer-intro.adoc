= GraphXR Explorer 

GraphXR *_Explorer_* delivers property graph visualization and analytics in a project workspace, with no need to replicate or move data. Connection from the Google Cloud Marketplace can be established to a Spanner, Spanner Graph, or BigQuery data source. Limitations are:

* One Project only. 
* Limited to 50,000 nodes and 50,000 edges
* Simplified Visualization for SpannerGraph and BigQueryGraph.
* User-managed *UI Configuration* for additional GraphXR features such as Transforms, Map, Algorithms, and Extensions.

* xref:spanner-intro.adoc[*Spanner*]. Connect to a Spanner Graph or Spanner database, build and run graph queries, and explore a visual graph.
  
* xref:bigquery-intro.adoc[*BigQuery*]. Connect to BigQuery data source, model a graph directly in GraphXR, and explore a visual graph.
